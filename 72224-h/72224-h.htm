<p class="author">BY FLEET SURGEON.</p>

</div>

<p>The time is seven bells in the afternoon watch, and in the wardroom
of one of His Majesty’s battle-cruisers a yawning marine servant
with tousled hair and not too conspicuously clean a face is clattering
cups and saucers at regular intervals round the two long tables
which are the most obvious objects to be seen. Although it is a
bright summer’s day on deck, the electric lights are lit, the wardroom
skylights are battened down, and the heavy bomb-proof
shutters pulled into position. In all the ship, fore and aft, there
is not a space where normal daylight can enter except in a few of
the senior officers’ cabins and down the companion-ways. Without
being actually dirty, the whole living spaces are dingy and depressing.
On the mess decks the watch below are indulging in
their afternoon ‘caulk,’ stretched out on the tables or stools, with
their heads resting on their wooden ditty boxes, which are used as
pillows. Their forms are covered by watch coats, old hammocks,
or pieces of deck cloth, for the wind blows chilly in the North Sea
even on the thirty-first of May.</p>

<p>The wardroom is as depressing as the men’s quarters. It measures
roughly thirty feet by twenty; the walls are of white painted steel;
the floor is of steel covered with corticine, which has been coated
with red shellac varnish so that it may not absorb moisture. There
are two doorways opening on the port and starboard sides. The
furniture is of the simplest possible description, consisting of the
two long tables already mentioned, a smaller table, two sofas, three
easy-chairs, two fixed settees about ten feet long, a dilapidated-looking
piano covered with bundles of torn music, and two sideboards
in alcoves, in each of which is a sliding hatch communicating with
the pantry. The walls are bare except for a photograph of the
sinking <i>Bluecher</i>, an engraving of an earlier namesake of the ship,
and some charts and war maps hanging limply from drawing-pins,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[386]</span>
which fix them to wooden battens. In one corner is a coal stove,
the polished brass funnel of which, passing to the deck above, is
the only bright object in the room. Suspended from the beams
by their cords and covered with yellow silken shades whose colour
has long ago lost its pristine freshness and daintiness, are the electric
lights. The gentle swaying of the shades is the only indication
that the ship is at sea. Thanks to her turbine machinery, no noise
or movement can be felt, and she might be lying in harbour for all
there is to indicate otherwise.</p>

<p>The ship herself is one of the mammoths of the sea. When
describing her in comparison with any other ship, apply superlatives
and you will dimly reach some idea of her qualities. She is the
largest, fastest, most heavily armed, best armoured, best equipped,
highest horse-powered, best arranged engine of destruction of her
time. Compared with a merchant ship, she has over twice the
horse-power of the <i>Aquitania</i>. Her crew is well over a thousand.
She has been blooded already, and her officers have supreme
confidence in her and themselves. For over an hour, practically
single-handed, she has fought the fleeing German battle-cruisers,
whilst her supporting consorts were endeavouring to catch her up.</p>

<p>A huge teapot containing a gallon of so-called tea is dropped
with a thud on one of the wardroom sideboards. Plates are rattled
violently as they are served around the table; there is a crash from
the pantry as the third-class officers’ steward, who has been sleeping
on top of the sink, strikes his yawning elbow against a pile of dirty
tumblers left over since lunch-time, and the marine servant shouts
out: ‘Tea is ready, gentlemen, please!’</p>

<p>There is a general movement from the settees, sofas and arm-chairs
where tired officers have been snatching a brief rest. Four
uncurl themselves from the small table where they have been sitting
on high-backed chairs with their heads resting upon their arms.
There is a general movement towards the long tables where the
cups, saucers and plates show up startlingly white against the
approved Admiralty pattern of serge tablecloth, whose main recommendation
to the chooser must have been that it did not show the
dirt. The dark red flowers have long ago become hopelessly mixed
with the black background which is its most prominent feature
when new.</p>

<p>The officers—there are thirty when they are all mustered—sit
down at the tables and stare in front of them with the glassy, fixed
eyes and owlish expression of those newly awakened from unrefreshing
slumber in a tainted atmosphere. The marine servant,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[387]</span>
helped by another, carries round the enormous tin teapot and carelessly
splashes a portion of the fluid into each cup as he passes. On
the table are jugs containing ‘tinned cow’ and basins of brown
sugar which the officers push to one another. For food there is
good bread, butter and jam, and some musty fragments of old cake.
For five minutes or so the meal is consumed in silence, when a
signal messenger enters the wardroom and, with an air of conscious
importance, lays a signal on the table beside the senior officer
present. That individual gazes casually at it for a second, and
then is suddenly galvanised into action. Holding it in both hands,
he reads out eagerly: ‘Flag to all ships. Our light cruisers report
that they have just sighted an enemy light cruiser.’</p>

<p>There is silence for a moment and then a voice is heard: ‘So
much the worse for the enemy light cruiser!’</p>

<p>The scraping of the chairs against the floor is heard as they
are hastily pushed back and the occupants rise, looking for their
caps. No need to tell them what that signal means. ‘Action
stations’ will be sounded in a few minutes.</p>

<p>A few whose duties are not so urgent remain behind, making
hasty efforts at finishing their tea. They guess it will be a long
time before they get the chance of another meal.</p>

<p>‘I’m a conscientious objector,’ says an engineer officer. ‘I
want to go home to mummy!’</p>

<p>‘And I’m a pacifist,’ remarks a lieutenant, ‘but that’s no reason
why I should drink filth as well as think it. Waiter! bring me a
cup of freshly-made tea, and don’t let the dog get this or you’ll
poison him.’</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">sang in unmelodious, raucous tones a paymaster.</p>

<p>‘Oh, shut up!’ said another. ‘There it goes.’</p>

<p>The bugle-call for ‘Action stations’ was heard gradually getting
louder as the bugle-boy ran along the passage outside.</p>

<p>‘That puts the hat on it! No tea, no nuffink! Now for a drop
of frightfulness. Wonder whether Fritz has any new gas shells.’</p>

<p>‘Put your respirator on first and sniff afterwards,’ said a doctor,
as they crushed through the doorway together. ‘If you really want
to sell that Gieve you were blowing about yesterday, I’ll give you
an I.O.U. for a bob for it.’</p>

<p>‘No good!’ replied the lieutenant. ‘I’ve sold it to a snotty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span>
for a quid. His people sent him two pounds ten to buy one, and
we went a burst on the thirty bob.’</p>

<p>‘Well, so long!’ said the doctor, as they parted at the bottom
of a ladder. ‘If you fall into my hands you will be more cut up
than I shall be.’</p>

<p>‘Go to the devil, you blood-thirsty abomination,’ shouted the
lieutenant, and, seizing the rungs, ran rapidly up the horizontal
ladder.</p>

<p>As he reached the upper deck and ran along towards the bridge
ladders, he cast a glance round the horizon. ‘Visibility so-so!’
he thought; ‘but if it gets no worse than at present it will do.
Can see 18,000 easily. Clouds a bit low though—not much more
than a thousand up.’</p>

<p>He ran up the bridge ladders and finally reached the upper bridge,
where the captain and navigating officer, officer of the watch, and
signalmen were busy getting ready to go down to the armoured
conning-tower. Above him towered the foremast, a central thick
steel tube supported by two smaller steel tubes running down and
outwards to the deck. On the after side of the central tube, dropped
steel rungs were let into the mast; and, seizing hold of these, he
climbed rapidly upwards until he reached the trap-door communicating
with the top. Pushing up the door, he pulled himself bodily
upwards and at last stood on the platform, a hundred and twenty
feet above the level of the sea.</p>

<p>He was in a circular box about ten feet in diameter, covered with
a roof and with bulwarks rising breast-high all the way round. His
duty was spotting for the secondary armament, and to assist him
there were two other officers and eight men acting as range-takers,
messengers, timekeepers, and in charge of deflection instruments.
He gave the range for the guns to the transmitting station, watched
the fall of the shot, estimated its distance over or short of the target,
and supplied the necessary corrections. As it was useless to expect
that firing the secondary guns would be of any value until the
range came down to about 12,000 yards, or to repel destroyer or
light cruiser attack, there would be a long interval of waiting before
he would have anything to do. Meanwhile, he went round the
instruments and saw that they were all in working order, tested the
voice tubes, and gave hints and instructions to his subordinates.</p>

<p>The sky was rapidly becoming more overcast and the clouds were
lower, although the horizon was still plainly visible.</p>

<p>A message came up the voice-tube from the conning-tower,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[389]</span>
warning him to keep a sharp look-out on the port bow as the enemy
battle-cruisers should be shortly sighted proceeding in a northerly
direction. Every sense was subordinated to that of sight, and
in the tense stillness he strained his eyes until the sockets hurt.
Looking down on the ship, which was spread like a map beneath
his feet, no sign of life was visible, although behind armoured side
and beneath thick steel hoods eager-eyed men were chafing at the
delay.</p>

<p>It was easy to see that the ships were travelling at full speed,
and the smoke belching from the ships ahead blurred his view and
damaged his eyes until he remembered the pair of motor goggles
he had supplied himself with.</p>

<p>Suddenly his attention was riveted by a small patch of the horizon
where the haze seemed slightly thicker than elsewhere. To anyone
who had not spent long weary hours watching for just such a haze
it would have suggested nothing at all, even if it had been observed.
He picked up his binoculars, which were hanging round his neck
from a strap, and took a long, long look.</p>

<p>The other two officers watched his face carefully. Suddenly he
dropped the glasses from his eyes and turned to his companions.
‘Yes; that’s the enemy battle-cruisers all right. They are making
a sixteen-point turn. I wonder what their game is. Are they
running away as they did at the Dogger Bank, or are they falling
back on the High Seas Fleet. Anyhow, there’s the <i>Engadine</i>
sending up a seaplane.’</p>

<p>He watched the movements of the seaplane ship for a few minutes,
and then heaved a sigh of relief as a gigantic bird rose in flight from
her side.</p>

<p>‘We haven’t sighted any of their Zeppelins yet and they
would be useless in this atmosphere. If I know anything of the
<i>Engadine’s</i> people, we shall get all the information we need in a
little.’</p>

<p>If anything, there was an access of speed on the part of the
British ships. The officers in the top cowered behind the steel
bulwark which protected them a little; but tiny hurricanes played
around their coats and caps and pierced the almost Arctic clothing
they were wearing.</p>

<p>The enemy ships were rapidly becoming distinguishable as
funnels and masts hurrying beneath a pall of smoke. The hulls
were still under the rim of the horizon, but were gradually rising.</p>

<p>‘When we can see the hulls the range will be approximately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[390]</span>
24,000 yards, and firing will open any time after that,’ remarked
the lieutenant to an officer whose first action this was.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the range-finder was being rapidly adjusted by an
able seaman who, seated behind it, commenced singing out in a
monotonous voice with the suspicion of a shake of excitement in it:
‘22,000—20,500—19,000—18,000.’</p>

<p>As he reached the last figure, there was a spattering sound
in the seas on their port side, and huge columns of spray were
thrown 200 feet up in the air. Driven back by the wind, sheets of
water swept against the top and drenched the luckless crew. Heedless,
the lieutenant watched the fall of the shot and muttered:
‘Five hundred short. Damned good effort at opening the ball.’</p>

<p>As he spoke there was a thundering roar from the ship beneath
him, and he instinctively stepped back from the edge of the top to
avoid the blast from the guns beneath. ‘That’s A turret firing’;
and as he traced the flight of the huge projectile which was plainly
visible winging its way towards the distant speck, he waited
anxiously for the splash which would indicate its fall. ‘Good
hunting! About five hundred short, too!’</p>

<p>These were not his guns and were not under his control; but
he knew that the capable lieutenant spotting in the gun control
tower below him, and the warrant officer in the top twenty feet
above him, would speedily correct the error. His job was to wait
and watch.</p>

<p>The action had become general. Shells, looking like Gargantuan
hailstones, were falling on every side of him; while columns of
water, like geysers, were rising everywhere and obscuring the
range. As a shell whizzed past them and its breath pushed them
farther back into the top, a shout of admiration escaped him.
‘Straddled in the third salvo! Oh, by Jove! good shooting!
Hope we’re doing as well!’</p>

<p>The top rocked to the thundering reverberation of our own guns;
the air was thick with the cordite smoke; the whistle and shriek
of shells as they passed, hit, or burst short were as insistent as the
noise of a railway engine’s whistle in a tunnel; sheets of spray were
wafted up to them and fell like waterfalls without making any distinguishable
sound; whilst, as he caught sight of them between
the showers, the range-finder’s voice, all trace of excitement gone,
went on with its monotonous sing-song: ‘17,000—16,500—15,000.’</p>

<p>For a second the officer glanced at the ships ahead. Even as
he turned, he saw three enemy shells falling on the next ahead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[391]</span></p>

<p>The voice of the man at the range-finder again took up the
refrain: ‘15,000—14,500—14,000.’</p>

<p>The hulls of the enemy ships were now plainly visible, but the
range was still too great for the secondary armament to be of any
value against the thickly armoured sides of the German ships.
Would they never come any nearer? As if in reply to his
question, he suddenly saw a line of low black hulls emerge from
behind the enemy ships and come tearing in a line diagonally
towards him.</p>

<p>Here was work at last! Seizing the navyphone, he shouted
down to the captain: ‘Destroyer attack on the port bow. Request
permission to open fire.’ The reply came back: ‘Open fire at
10,000.’</p>

<p>Dropping the navyphone, he picked up the voice tube and
commenced the orders to the transmitting station which would let
loose six thousand six hundred pounds of shell per minute at the
rapidly approaching enemy.</p>

<p>‘Destroyer. One mast, two funnels.</p>

<p>‘Range 9500. Deflection 16 right. Rate 550 closing.</p>

<p>‘Load with lyddite. Salvoes.</p>

<p>‘Shoot!’</p>

<p>Anxiously he gazed at the leader of the approaching destroyers.
Good shooting, but a little to the left. Undoubtedly she was hit
or, at least, badly spattered, as she altered course a little. Correcting
this, he shouted down: ‘Shoot!’</p>

<p>Again the deadly hail smothered the little vessel in foam. From
the top the men on her decks could be clearly seen training the
torpedo tubes and getting ready to fire. As she approached, the
order was given: ‘Down 400! Shoot!’</p>

<p>There was a sudden burst of speed on the part of the destroyer,
which was immediately allowed for.</p>

<p>‘Down 400. Close rate 200. Rate 750 closing! Shoot!’</p>

<p>‘Good hunting!’ he muttered, as the destroyer swerved in her
path and, apparently badly injured, commenced to alter her course
so as to get out of action.</p>

<p>Smoke and flame were belching from her forward, whilst amidships
a ragged hole in her side could be seen from which great clouds
of steam came out in gasps. She was heeling towards him, and the
crew could be seen plainly through glasses, fitting on their life-belts
and dragging at the falls of their badly damaged whaler. Rafts
were being cast loose, and the deck was strewn with bodies which,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[392]</span>
even as they watched, commenced to roll slowly down the sloping
deck.</p>

<p>‘Not much need to worry about him!’ thought the lieutenant.
‘He’s finished. Time to get on with the next.’</p>

<p>The second destroyer had been attended to by the ship astern,
but the third was still coming on, apparently uninjured. She was
rapidly altering both course and speed in order to avoid the deadly
salvoes and spoil the range-finding.</p>

<p>‘Oh, that’s your game,’ said the officer. ‘We’ll see what we
can do for you.’ Speaking down the voice-pipe again, he shouted:
‘Object shifted. Third destroyer from left. Range 8500. Same
deflection and rate! Salvoes! Shoot!’</p>

<p>All-overs was reported by the spotter.</p>

<p>‘Down 400. Shoot!’</p>

<p>‘One hit, others short!’ shouted the spotter.</p>

<p>‘Up 200. Shoot!’</p>

<p>There was no need to listen to the spotter this time. The middle
of the destroyer rose in the air and then burst asunder. With
a roar, she broke in halves, and bow and stem were elevated skyward
until she assumed the shape of the letter V. Almost instantaneously
she disappeared. As she did so, she went straight
downwards as if plucked under by a gigantic hand. The fourth
destroyer put her helm hard over and turned sixteen points. She
had been hit once by the ship astern and had evidently had enough.</p>

<p>The lieutenant chuckled. ‘Gave Fritz what-for that time!
Guess our destroyers could have done better than that!</p>

<p>‘Cease firing!’</p>

<p>For the time being, the destroyer attack had been foiled, but
others were sure to come, and, smothered in spray, the men on the
top kept anxiously on the alert. As they looked ahead, they saw
first one, then another, then several separate clouds of smoke on
the horizon. The German battle-cruisers were heading straight
for them, and the meaning of that was all too plain. Evidently
these distant vessels were the German High Seas Fleet. The
range of the German battle-cruisers was rapidly getting less, and
it was possible to start shooting at them with the secondary armament
with a fair chance of hitting.</p>

<p>The lieutenant began to give his orders again, after asking permission
from the captain. And, busy and capable as he was professionally,
another part of his brain was speaking to his inner
consciousness. ‘This is <i>Der Tag</i> at last. Thank heaven we’re
in it. Verdun must have been a failure. Where is Jellicoe? We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[393]</span>
can’t take on all these beggars by ourselves! Wonder how long
Beatty is going to carry on! Their guns are badly rattled: they
haven’t hit us a fair smack for over an hour.’</p>

<p>The rapidly advancing High Seas Fleet was approaching the
parallel lines of fighting battle-cruisers. Still Beatty held on!
But the lieutenant had no doubts in his own mind. ‘Jellicoe can’t
be far away, and we are going to hold them until he comes up.
May it be soon!’</p>

<p>Still the battle-cruisers held on, while the German battleships
commenced firing at long ranges.</p>

<p>At last the signal to go about was given, and the helm was
jammed hard a-port so that the big ship heeled heavily over as she
spun round. As she did so, it was obvious enough that the German
battle-cruisers were doing the same and racing back in the direction
they had come. They had apparently got the idea that Beatty
was trying to avoid them and was suffering too much punishment
to be able to reply effectually. But that officer had his own game
to play and knew as soon as the German battle-cruisers turned
immediately after him that they had fallen into the very error he
had desired them to make.</p>

<p>The Fifth Battle Squadron had now joined up and was engaging
both the enemy’s cruisers and battleships, and, as far as the battle
was concerned, the day was now more in favour of the British.</p>

<p>As the ships swung round, one after the other, keeping perfect
station as if at manœuvres, they fired their broadsides with telling
effect, which was plainly seen, at the German battleships, which
responded indifferently.</p>

<p>It was easy for those in the top to guess what Beatty’s tactics
were. Evidently, Jellicoe was somewhere up in the north-west,
and the whole German Fleet were walking straight into his hands.
If only the light would hold, but already, although it was barely
5 P.M., the horizon was becoming misty and the outlines of the enemy
ships were no longer sharply defined. To control effectively this
long length of battle line, good light was absolutely essential.</p>

<p>Still Beatty sped along, keeping station on the German cruisers
at 13,000 yards, leaving their battleships to the Fifth Battle
Squadron. The Germans by this time were suffering heavily, and
the <i>Lutzow</i> was seen to drop out of the line.</p>

<p>Suddenly, ahead on the port bow, were seen the welcome signs
of the Grand Fleet arriving at last. There was no longer any doubt
as to what the result would be. Inevitable defeat was staring the
Germans in the face. With the instinct of the born fighting sailor,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[394]</span>
Beatty seized the chance to turn the German defeat into a rout.
The battle-cruisers leaped ahead at full speed and he dashed like
a fury across towards the head of the German line in order to concentrate
on their leading ships and crumple their formation. The
manœuvre was perfectly successful. The German line bent, broke
and fled, but the thick mist which had gradually been coming down
robbed Jellicoe of the fruits of his victory. As the Grand Fleet
deployed into line and brought their guns to bear on the enemy’s
line, they found for target an occasional wraith-like hull appearing
for a few seconds between the banks of smoke and fog. The battle-cruisers
were in the same quandary, firing at intervals at the flashes
which showed the position of the German ships. The utmost
confusion apparently reigned on board them, and in the thick fog
and scattered condition of both fleets, to go on with the action was
impossible.</p>

<p>Once again, as often before, the weather conditions had favoured
the defeated, and both fleets mutually broke off action—the Germans
to flee for their home ports, and the British to re-form for the battle
at dawn.</p>

<p>During the night, that best test of the morale of a fleet, a
destroyer attack, was carried out by the British with marked
success; but there was no retaliation on the part of the Germans.
They had had enough and more than enough.</p>

<p>At 10.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> a group of stiff and wearied officers left the top
and made for the wardroom to get some food. The forsaken
afternoon tea was still standing as it had been left on the table, and,
lying about on chairs, sofas and settees, were men too wearied even
to desire to eat.</p>

<p>They sat and looked at one another and said nothing. Members
of the mess who had been joyfully skylarking eight hours before
would never draw their chairs up to the table again. One who had
left his cup of tea untasted had drunk to the dregs the cup that
Death had offered him. Only one officer made a remark: ‘The
action is to be resumed at dawn.’ And only one man made a reply:
‘They won’t get away this time.’</p>

<p>But they did. A Zeppelin was sighted at 3.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, evidently
shadowing the British Fleet. For ten hours they cruised over the
battle area strewn with the horrible relics of the fight, but the
Germans were nowhere to be seen. They had gone home to
celebrate their victory by getting their wounded into hospital,
their dead buried, and their sunken ships renamed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IN_THE_WOOD"><i>IN THE WOOD.</i></h2>

<p class="author">BY BOYD CABLE.</p>

</div>

<p>The attack on the wood had begun soon after dawn, and it
was no more than 8 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> when the Corporal was dropped badly
wounded in the advance line of the attack where it had penetrated
about four hundred yards into the wood. But it was well into afternoon
before he sufficiently woke to his surroundings to understand
where he was or what had happened, and when he did so he found
the realisation sufficiently unpleasant. It was plain from several
indications—the direction from which the shells bursting in his
vicinity were coming, a glimpse of some wounded Germans retiring,
the echoing rattle of rifle fire and crash of bombs behind him—that
the battalion had been driven back, as half a dozen other battalions
had been driven back in the course of the ebb-and-flow fighting
through the wood for a couple of weeks past, that he was lying
badly wounded and helpless to defend himself where the Germans
could pick him up as a prisoner or finish him off with a saw-backed
bayonet as the mood of his discoverers turned. His left leg was
broken below the knee, his right shoulder and ribs ached intolerably,
a scalp wound six inches long ran across his head from side to side—a
wound that, thanks to the steel shrapnel helmet lying dinted in
deep across the crown, had not split his head open to the teeth.</p>

<p>He felt, as he put it to himself, ‘done in,’ so utterly done in, that
for a good hour he was willing to let it go at that, to lie still and wait
whatever luck brought him, almost indifferent as to whether it
would be another rush that would advance the British line and bring
him within reach of his own stretcher-bearers, or his discovery
by some of the German soldiers who passed every now and then
close to where he lay.</p>

<p>Thirst drove him to fumble for his water-bottle, only to find, when
he had twisted it round, that a bullet had punctured it, and that it
was dry; and, after fifteen tortured minutes, thirst drove him to
the impossible, and brought him crawling and dragging his broken
leg to a dead body and its full bottle. An eager, choking swallow
and a long breath-stopping, gurgling draught gave him more life
than he had ever thought to feel again, a sudden revulsion of feeling
against the thought of waiting helpless there to be picked up and
carted to a German prison camp or butchered where he lay a quick<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396"></a>[396]</span>
hope and a desperate resolve to attempt to escape such a fate. He
had managed to crawl to the water-bottle; he would attempt to
crawl at least a little nearer to the fighting lines, to where he would
have more chance of coming under the hands of his own men. Without
waste of time he took hasty stock of his wounds and set about
preparing for his attempt. The broken leg was the most seriously
crippling, but with puttees, bayonets, and trenching-tool handles he
so splinted and bound it about that he felt he could crawl and drag
it behind him. He attempted to bandage his head, but his arm and
shoulder were so stiff and painful when he lifted his hand to his head
that he desisted and satisfied himself with a water-soaked pad placed
inside a shrapnel helmet. Then he set out to crawl.</p>

<p>It is hard to convey to anyone who has not seen such a place,
the horrible difficulty of the task the Corporal had set himself.
The wood had been shelled for weeks, until almost every tree in it
had been smashed and knocked down and lay in a wild tangle of
trunks, tops, and branches on the ground. The ground itself was
pitted with big and little shell-holes, seamed with deep trenches,
littered with whole and broken arms and equipments, German and
British grenades and bombs, scattered thick with British and
German dead who had lain there for any time from hours to weeks.
And into and over it all the shells were still crashing and roaring.
The air palpitated to their savage rushing, the ground trembled
to the impact of their fall, and without pause or break the deep
roll of the drumming gun-fire bellowed and thundered. But
through all the chaos men were still fighting, and would continue
to fight, and the Corporal had set his mind doggedly to come somewhere
near to where they fought. The penetration of such a jungle
might have seemed impossible even to a sound and uninjured man;
to one in his plight it appeared mere madness to attempt. And
yet to attempt it he was determined, and being without any other
idea in his throbbing head but the sole one of overcoming each
obstacle as he came to it, had no time to consider the impossibility
of the complete task.</p>

<p>Now, two hundred yards is a short distance as measurement goes,
but into those two hundred yards through the chaos of wrecked
wood the Corporal packed as much suffering, as dragging a passage
of time, as many tortures of hope and fear and pain, as would
fill an ordinary lifetime. Every yard was a desperate struggle,
every fallen tree-trunk, each tangle of fallen branch, was a cruel
problem to be solved, a pain-racked and laborious effort to overcome.
A score of times he collapsed and lay panting, and resigned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a>[397]</span>
himself to abandoning the struggle; and a score of times he roused
himself and fought down numbing pain, and raised himself on
trembling arms and knees to crawl again, to wriggle through the
wreckage, to hoist himself over some obstacle, to fight his way on
for another yard or two. Every conscious thought was busied
only and solely with the problems of his passage that presented
themselves one by one, but at the back of his mind some self-working
reason or instinct held him to his direction, took heed of what
went on around him, guided him in action other than that
immediately concerned with his passage. When, for instance, he
came to a deep trench cutting across his path, he sat long with his
whole mind occupied on the question as to whether he should move
to right or left, whether the broken place half a dozen yards off the
one way or the more completely broken one a dozen yards the other
would be the best to make for, scanning this way down and that
way up, a litter of barbed wire here and a barrier of broken branches
there; and yet, without even lifting his mind from the problem,
he was aware of grey coats moving along the trench towards him,
had sense enough to drop flat and lie huddled and still until the
Germans had passed. And that second mind again advised him
against crawling down into the trench and making his easier way
along it, because it was too probable it would be in use as a passage
for Germans, wounded and unwounded.</p>

<p>He turned and moved slowly along the edge of the trench at
last, and held to it for some distance because the parapet raised
along its edge held up many of the fallen trees and branches enough
to let him creep under them. That advantage was discounted to
some extent by the number of dead bodies that lay heaped on or
under the parapet and told of the struggles and the fierce fighting
that had passed for possession of the trench, but on the whole the
dead men were less difficult to pass than the clutching, wrenching
fingers of the dead wood. The pains in his head, shoulder, and
side had by now dulled down to a dead numbness, but his broken
leg never ceased to burn and stab with red-hot needles of agony;
and for all the splints encasing it and despite all the care he took,
there was hardly a yard of his passage that was not marked by
some wrenching catch on his foot, some jarring shock or grind and
grate of the broken bones.</p>

<p>He lost count of time, he lost count of distance, but he kept
on crawling. He was utterly indifferent to the turmoil of the
guns, to the rush and yell of the near-falling shells, the crash of their
bursts, the whirr of the flying splinters. When he had been well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[398]</span>
and whole these things would have brought his heart to his mouth,
would have set him ducking and dodging and shrinking. Now
he paid them no fraction of his absorbed attention. But to the
distinctive and rising sounds of bursting grenades, to the sharp
whip and whistle of rifle bullets about him and through the leaves
and twigs, he gave eager attention because they told him he was
nearing his goal, was coming at last to somewhere near the fringe
of the fighting. His limbs were trembling under him, he was
throbbing with pain from head to foot, his head was swimming
and his vision was blurred and dim, and at last he was forced to
drop and lie still and fight to recover strength to move, and sense
to direct his strength. His mind cleared slowly, and he saw at
last that he had come to a slightly clearer part of the wood, to a
portion nearer its edge where the trees had thinned a little and
where the full force of the shell blast had wrecked and re-wrecked
and torn fallen trunks and branches to fragments.</p>

<p>But although his mind had recovered, his body had not. He
found he could barely raise himself on his shaking arms—had not
the strength to crawl another yard. He tried and tried again,
moved no more than bare inches, and had to drop motionless again.</p>

<p>And there he lay and watched a fresh attack launched by the
British into the wood, heard and saw the tornado of shell-fire that
poured crashing and rending and shattering into the trees, watched
the khaki figures swarm forward through the smoke, the spitting
flames of the rifles, the spurting fire and smoke of the flung grenades.
He still lay on the edge of the broken trench along which he had
crept, and he could just make out that this ran off at an angle away
from him and that it was held by the Germans, and formed probably
the point of the British attack. He watched the attack with consuming
eagerness, hope flaming high as he saw the khaki line press
forward, sinking again to leaden depths as it halted or held or
swayed back. To him the attack was an affair much more vital
than the taking of the trench, the advance by a few score yards
of the British line. To him it meant that a successful advance
would bring him again within the British lines, its failure leave
him still within the German.</p>

<p>Into the trench below him a knot of Germans scrambled scuffling,
and he lay huddled there almost within arm’s length of them while
they hoisted a couple of machine-guns to the edge of the trench and
manned the parapet and opened a hail of fire down the length of
the struggling British line. Under that streaming fire the line
wilted and withered; a fresh torrent of fire smote it, and it crumpled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[399]</span>
and gave and ebbed back. But almost immediately another line
swarmed up out of the smoke and swept forward, and this time,
although the same flank and frontal fire caught and smote it, the
line straggled and swayed forward and plunged into and over the
German trench.</p>

<p>The Corporal lying there on the trench edge was suddenly
aware of a stir amongst the men below him. The edge where he
lay half screened in a débris of green stuff and huddled beside a
couple of dead Germans was broken down enough to let him see
well into the trench, and he understood to the full the meaning of
the movements of the Germans in the trench, of their hasty hauling
down of the machine-guns, their scrambling retirement crouched
and hurrying along the trench back in the direction from which
he had come. The trench the British had taken ran out at a right
angle from this one where he lay, and the Germans near him were
retiring behind the line of trench that had been taken. And that
meant he was as good as saved.</p>

<p>A minute later two khaki figures emerged from a torn thicket
of tree stumps and branches a dozen yards beyond the trench
where he lay, and ran on across towards the denser wood into which
the Germans had retreated. One was an officer, and close on their
heels came half a dozen, a dozen, a score of men, all following close
and pressing on to the wood and opening out as they went. One
came to the edge of the trench where the machine-guns had been,
and the Corporal with an effort lifted and waved an arm and shouted
hoarsely to him. But even as he did so he realised how futile his
shout was, how impossible it was for it to carry even the few yards
in the pandemonium of noise that raved about them. But he
shouted again, and yet again, and felt bitter disappointment as
the man without noticing turned and moved along the trench,
peering down into it.</p>

<p>The Corporal had a sudden sense of someone moving behind
him, and twisted round in time to see another khaki figure moving
past a dozen paces away and the upper half bodies of half a score
more struggling through the thickets beyond. This time he
screamed at them, but they too passed unhearing and unheeding.
The Corporal dropped quivering and trying to tell himself that it
was all right, that there would be others following, that some of
them must come along the trench, that the stretcher-bearers would
be following close.</p>

<p>But for the moment none followed them, and from where they
had vanished came a renewed uproar of grenade-bursts and rifle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[400]</span>
fire beating out and through the uproar of the guns and the screaming,
crashing shells. The Corporal saw a couple of wounded come
staggering back ... the tumult of near fighting died down ... a
line of German grey-clad shoulders and bobbing ‘coal-scuttle’
helmets plunged through and beyond the thicket from which the
khaki had emerged a few minutes before. And then back into the
trench below him scuffled the Germans with their two machine-guns.
With a groan the Corporal dropped his face in the dirt and
dead leaves and groaned hopelessly. He was ‘done in,’ he told
himself, ‘clean done in.’ He could see no chance of escape. The
line had been driven back, and the last ounce of strength to crawl....
He tried once more before he would finally admit that last
ounce gone, but the effort was too much for his exhausted limbs
and pain-wrenched body. He dropped to the ground again.</p>

<p>The rapid clatter of the two machine-guns close to him lifted
his head to watch. The main German trench was spouting dust
and débris, flying clouds of leaves, flashing white slivers of bark
and wood, under the torrent of shells that poured on it once more.
The machine-guns below him ceased, and the Corporal concluded
that their target had gone for the moment. But that intense bombardment
of the trench almost certainly meant the launching of
another British attack, and then the machine-guns would find their
target struggling again across their sights and under their streaming
fire. They had a good ‘field of fire,’ too, as the Corporal could see.
The British line had to advance for the most part through the waist-high
tangle of wrecked wood, but by chance or design a clearer
patch of ground was swept close to the German trench, and as the
advance crossed this the two machine-guns on the flank near the
Corporal would get in their work, would sweep it in enfilade, would
be probably the worst obstacle to the advance. And at that a riot
of thoughts swept the Corporal’s mind. If he could out those
machine-guns ... if he could out those machine-guns ... but
how? There were plenty of rifles near, and plenty of dead about
with cartridges on them ... but one shot would bring the Germans
jumping from their trench on him.... Bombs now ... if he
had some Mills’ grenades ... where had he seen....</p>

<p>He steadied himself deliberately and thought back. The
whole wood was littered with grenades, spilt and scattered broadcast
singly and in heaps—German stick-grenades and Mills’. He
remembered crawling past a dead bomber with a bag full of Mills’
beside him only a score of yards away. Could he crawl to them
and back again? The Germans in the trench might see him;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[401]</span>
and anyhow—hadn’t he tried? And hadn’t he found the last
ounce of his strength gone?</p>

<p>But he found another last ounce. He half crawled, half dragged
himself back and found his bag of grenades, and with the full
bag hooked over his shoulder and a grenade clutched ready in his
hand felt himself a new man. His strength was gone, but it takes
little strength to pull the pin of a grenade, and if any German
rushed him now, at least they’d go together.</p>

<p>The machine-guns broke out again, and the Corporal, gasping
and straining, struggled foot by foot back towards them. The
personal side—the question of his own situation and chances of
escape—had left him. He had forgotten himself. His whole mind
was centred on the attack, on the effect of those machine-guns’
fire, on the taking of the German trench. He struggled past the
break in the trench and on until he had shelter behind the low
parapet. He wanted some cover. One grenade wasn’t enough.
He wanted to make sure, and he wouldn’t chance a splinter from his
own bomb.</p>

<p>The machine-guns were chattering and clattering at top speed,
and as he pulled the pin of his first grenade the Corporal saw another
gun being dragged up beside the others. He held his grenade and
counted ‘one-and-two-and-<i>throw</i>—’ and lobbed the grenade over
into the trench under the very feet of the machine-gunners. He
hastily pulled another pin and threw the grenade ... and as a
spurt of smoke and dust leaped from the trench before him and the
first grenades <i>crash-crashed</i>, he went on pulling out the pins and flinging
over others as fast as he could pitch. The trench spouted fire
and dust and flying dirt and débris, the ground shook beneath him,
he was half stunned with the quick-following reports—but the
machine-guns had stopped on the first burst.</p>

<p>That was all he remembered. This time the last ounce was
really gone, and he was practically unconscious when the stretcher-bearers
found him after the trench was taken and the attack had
passed on deep into the wood.</p>

<p>And weeks after, lying snug in bed in a London hospital, after
a Sister had scolded him for moving in bed and reaching out for a
magazine that had dropped to the floor, and told him how urgent it
was that he must not move, and how a fractured leg like his must
be treated gently and carefully if he did not wish to be a cripple
for life, and so on and so forth, he grinned up cheerfully at her.
‘Orright, Sister,’ he said, ‘I’ll remember. But it’s a good job for
me I didn’t know all that, back there—in the wood.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_TALK_WITH_COLERIDGE"><i>A TALK WITH COLERIDGE.</i></h2>

</div>

<p><i>Abstract of a discourse with Mr. Coleridge on the state of the
country in December 1830, written at the time by John Frere.</i><a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p class="tb">[While staying with the daughter of Mr. John Frere I came across
this paper in one of the many manuscript volumes in his writing.
Educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, he was one of
those known as the ‘Apostles’ at Cambridge, and Charles and
Alfred Tennyson were among his friends as well as Arthur Hallam,
whom he admired greatly, and Coleridge.</p>

<p>The volume is a quaint collection of many things—original
verses, extracts from books, and notes of sermons; and the reader
can only wish that a few of the evenings spent with the Apostles
might have been recorded within these marbled covers.</p>

<p>But this one conversation has a charm peculiarly its own, and
we will no longer keep the reader from entering the Hampstead
room well known to the literary men of the day, where silently
he may observe an old-world courtesy and ceremony belonging
to a past age, while listening to a discourse only too seldom to be
heard.]</p>

<p class="tb"><i>C.</i> Is there anything stirring now in the world of letters, anything
in the shape of poetry lately produced, for I see nothing
of the sort, nor even a Review that is not a year old?</p>

<p><i>F.</i> No, Sir, at least I have heard no talk of any such thing;
these continual burnings occupy all men’s thoughts and conversation.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> And what remedies are proposed? They talk I suppose
of retrenchments, but what good can retrenchment do? Alas!
revolutionary times are times of general demoralisation; what
great men do they ever produce? What was produced by the late<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[403]</span>
Revolutionary Spirit in France? There must be something
uppermost to be sure in such disturbances; some military superiority,
but what great—I mean truly great—man was produced?</p>

<p>In England the same spirit was curbed in and worsted by the
moral sense, afterwards there followed times of repose, and the
Muses began to show themselves. But now what is going forward?
The depravity of the spirit of the times is marked by the
absence of poetry. For it is a great mistake to suppose that thought
is not necessary for poetry; true, at the time of composition there
is that starlight, a dim and holy twilight; but is not light necessary
before?</p>

<p>Poetry is the highest effort of the mind; all the powers are
in a state of equilibrium and equally energetic, the knowledge
of individual existence is forgotten, the man is out of himself
and exists in all things, his eye in <i>a</i> fine &amp;c.</p>

<p>There is no one perhaps who composes with more facility
than your Uncle; but does it cost him nothing before? It is
the result of long thought; and poetry as I have before observed
must be the result of thought, and the want of thought in what
is now called poetry is a bad sign of the times.</p>

<p>There is a want of the proper spirit; if a nation would flourish
(politically speaking) there must be a desire in the breast of each
man of something more than merely to live—he must desire to
live well; and if men cannot live well at home they will go and
live well elsewhere. The condition upon which a country circumstanced
as ours is exists, is that it should become the Mother
of Empires, and this Mr. W. Horton feels, but his plans are not
extensive or universal enough. I had a conversation with him,
but could not make him enter into my views. We ought to send
out colonies, but not privately or by parishes; it should be a
grand National concern; there should be in every family one or
more brought up for this and this alone.</p>

<p>A Father should say, ‘There, John now is a fine strong fellow and
an enterprising lad, he shall be a colonist.’</p>

<p>But then some fool-like Lord ⸺ gets up and tells us ‘Oh no!
America should be a warning.’</p>

<p>Good Heavens, Sir! a warning, and of what? Are we to
beware of having 2 [sets?] of men bound to us by the ties of allegiance
and of affinity; 2 [sets] of men in a distant part of the world
speaking the language of Shakspear and Milton, and living under
the laws of Alfred. But a warning they should be to us, to give<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[404]</span>
freely and in good time that liberty which is their due, and which
they will properly extort from us if we withhold.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Is it not moreover true, Sir, that we should show ourselves
really a Mother and not a Stepmother to those Empires which we
found? We should with a nursing hand lead them through the
dangers of infancy; but why keep them in leading strings when they
are able to act for themselves? We should relax our hold by
slow degrees as they are able to bear it, and nurture them to be
free and manly states, and not the slaves of any, still less of their
own Mother. What Mother ever complains of the ingratitude of
her Son because he does not follow at her apron-strings all the days
of his life? Why then do we complain of America, who with
greater justice might complain of us that we have been far from
remembering one great duty, namely that a Mother if need be
should even sacrifice herself for her child?</p>

<p><i>C.</i> What you say is very true; but with regard to the execution
of a plan of Colonisation, why should we not make the absurd
system of Poor Laws subservient to the measure?</p>

<p>Why not, since as Sir N. T.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> told Bartle the other day, An
offer and refusal is as good as an acceptance, propose to any person
requiring assistance of the overseer the following terms:—We
have it is true bound ourselves by a most foolish promise to find
you work; we have none here, but if you choose to go out to the
Swan River, you shall have as much as you want, and we will
carry you out there, your wife and your children too, if you have
them, and you shall get your livelihood in an honorable and independent
way—and mind you are now to consider us discharged
of our promise to find you work.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> It is true that this would be fair enough, but as long as
the poor man sees the rich enjoy a liberty which he does not, viz.
that of living in the land in which he was born, he would complain,
and not without reason. Let then the young and active in the
higher ranks set them the example. And why should the unlearned
be deprived of the countenance and assistance of the wiser? What
can hand do without head, especially in untamed countries?
Heaven knows the labouring classes have been most iniquitously
considered for some time and are now becoming, as Mr. Coleridge
says, more things than persons, and are therefore more than ever
unfit to be sent alone.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> And therefore the younger sons of noblemen and the fops<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405"></a>[405]</span>
of town would have been employed in a manner much better
for their country, and more happy for themselves had they been
brought up as members and limbs of a colony instead of thrusting
themselves into situations to which they do not naturally belong,
and to the exclusion of all competition, or wasting their energies
at Newmarket or in Crockfords.</p>

<p class="tb"><i>C.</i> Almost all thinking Jews are Deists. I wonder Mr. ⸺
should ever have talked with you on those subjects; the persecution
which a Jew would undergo from his brethren if it was known that
he did so, is not to be calculated. The life, you know, of Spinoza
was twice attempted, but he professed Christianity, at least in
his way in a letter to a friend; for he said that if the Logos could be
manifested in the flesh, it must converse and act as Jesus did. At
the same time his notions of a God were very Pantheistic, a ⊙le.
whose centre is everywhere and circumference nowhere. He had
no notion of a Conscious Being of a God—but with these ideas to
talk of God becoming flesh appears to me very much like talking
of a square ⊙le.</p>

<p>Spinoza is a man whom I most deeply reverence, I was going
to say whom I reverence as much as it is possible for me to reverence
any creature. He was on the borders of the truth, and would no
doubt had he lived have attained it.</p>

<p>But bless me! to talk of converting the Jews, people are not
aware of what they undertake.</p>

<p>Mr. ⸺ say’d to me, and I thought very beautifully, ‘Convert
the Jews! Alas, Sir, Mammon and Ignorance are the two giant
porters who stand at the gates of Jerusalem and forbid the entrance
of Truth.’</p>

<p class="tb"><i>F.</i> You have not read much of Keats, Sir, I think.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> No, I have not. I have seen two Sonnets which I think
showed marks of a great genius had he lived. I have also read a
poem with a classical name—I forget what. Poor Keats, I saw
him once. Mr. Green,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> whom you have heard me mention, and I
were walking out in these parts, and we were overtaken by a young
man of a very striking countenance whom Mr. Green recognised
and shook hands with, mentioning my name; I wish Mr. Green had
introduced me, for I did not know who it was. He passed on, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406"></a>[406]</span>
in a few moments sprung back and said, ‘Mr. Coleridge, allow me
the honour of shaking your hand.’</p>

<p>I was struck by the energy of his manner, and gave him my
hand.</p>

<p>He passed on and we stood still looking after him, when Mr.
Green said,</p>

<p>‘Do you know who that is? That is Keats, the poet.’</p>

<p>‘Heavens!’ said I, ‘when I shook him by the hand there was
death!’ This was about two years before he died.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> But what was it?</p>

<p><i>C.</i> I cannot describe it. There was a heat and a dampness in
the hand. To say that his death was caused by the Review is absurd,
but at the same time it is impossible adequately to conceive the
effect which it must have had on his mind.</p>

<p>It is very well for those who have a place in the world and are
independent to talk of these things, they can bear such a blow, so
can those who have a strong religious principle; but all men are
not born Philosophers, and all men have not those advantages of
birth and education.</p>

<p>Poor Keats had not, and it is impossible I say to conceive
the effect which such a Review<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> must have had upon him, knowing
as he did that he had his way to make in the world by his own
exertions, and conscious of the genius within him.</p>

<p>Have you seen, Mr. F., anything of Lord Byron’s poetry?</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Nothing, Sir, but the Translation of ‘Faust.’</p>

<p><i>C.</i> And what do you think of that?</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Being unacquainted, Sir, with the original I cannot speak of
its merits as a translation. As a poem I think it meagre, nor do I
conceive that the metres are adapted to the subject in English
whatever they may be in German.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> I have been asked why I did not translate the camp scenes
in ‘Wallenstein.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407"></a>[407]</span></p>

<p>The truth is that the labour would have been immense, and
besides it would not have been borne in English, to say nothing of
the fact that Mrs. Barbauld reviewed my translation of the rest of
the play and abused it through thick and thin, so that it sold for
wastepaper. I remember your uncle telling me that he had picked
it up—he approved it, so did Canning to whom he showed it—and
so might one or two more, but the edition sold for wastepaper.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Had you ever any thought of translating the ‘Faust’?</p>

<p><i>C.</i> Yes, Sir, I had, but I was prevented by the consideration that
though there are some exquisite passages, the opening chorus, the
chapel and the prison scenes for instance, to say nothing of the
Brocken scene where he has shown peculiar strength in keeping
clear of Shakspear, he has not taken that wonderful admixture
of Witch Fate and Fairy but has kept to the real original witch,
and this suits his purpose much better. I say that a great
deal of it I do not admire, and some I reprobate. The conception of
Wagner is bad: whoever heard of a man who had gained such
wonderful proficiency in learning as to call up spirits &amp;c. being
discontented?</p>

<p>No, it is not having the power of knowledge that would make a
man discontented—neither would such a man have suddenly become
a sensualist. The discourses too with the pupil are dull. The
Mephistapholes (<i>sic</i>), or whatever the name is, is well executed, but
the conception is not original. It was ⸺ who had before said,
‘The Devil is the great humourist of the world.’ There are other
parts too which I could not have translated without entering my
protest against them in a manner which would hardly have been
fair upon the author, for those things are understood in Germany
in a spirit very different from what they would infuse here in
England. To give you an example, the scene where Mephistopheles
is introduced as coming before the Almighty and talking with Him
would never be borne in English and this whole scene is founded
on a mistranslation of a passage in Scripture, the opening of Job.
You remember how Satan means properly one who goes his rounds,
and hence it came to mean one of those officers whom the King in
Eastern countries used to send round to see how his subjects were
going on. This power was soon abused and the Satans used to
accuse people falsely, and hence the word came to have the
meaning now attached to it of a calumniator, a διάβολος, an accuser.</p>

<p>Now in the Book of Job (which is undoubtedly very ancient,
before the law for there is no mention of the law in it, undoubtedly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408"></a>[408]</span>
the most ancient book in the world) the word Satan meant only
this officer, the prime vizier of the Sultan (you remember in the
‘Arabian Nights’ the Caliph and his vizier are very fond of going
their rounds for the same purpose). God Almighty is shown to
us under the semblance of a mortal king holding his court, and
his officer comes, as the book tells us, ‘from going his rounds on
the earth and walking up and down in it,’ but mind there is nothing
like malignity attached to him.</p>

<p>The King asks him concerning Job—the officer answers that
he is a perfect man—but (adds he) ‘He has yet had no temptation;
he is prosperous, and he might alter if his circumstances were
altered.’</p>

<p>The King then commands him to try and to destroy his
possessions. (N.B.—This is a mistake, <i>He gives him leave</i>.)</p>

<p>Again on another day the same things happen and when the
officer is asked about Job he says ‘He is yet integer but many
men will do this. I can say nothing for his integrity as long as
his possessions only are touched; but stretch out your hand against
his person and see if he will curse Thee then?’ It is evident that
there is no suggestion, no evil in the officer at all—indeed the
belief in Angels and that sort of poultry is nowhere countenanced in
the Old Testament and in the New, nowhere else.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Indeed, Sir, I think I know a very strong passage.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> Well, what is it?</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Our Saviour tells his disciples when alone with them and
apart that a certain kind of Devils goeth not out but by prayer
and fasting.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> Well, and what has that to do with Angels?</p>

<p><i>F.</i> I beg your pardon, Sir. I thought you included devils in
your feathered fowl.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> There is nothing I say in the New Testament to countenance
the belief in Angels. For what are the three first Gospels? Every one
must see that they are mere plain narrations, not of things as they
are but of things as they appeared to the ignorant disciples—but
when we come to John, Mr. F., there we find the difference. He told
things as they were, and therefore you must not believe everything
that you read implicitly; and with respect to Devils entering into
a man, why it is quite absurd. What do we mean when we say a
thing is in another? Why ‘in’ is merely a relative term. [The
argument, though I was compelled to assent to it, I am sorry to
say was far above my comprehension, and therefore I could not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409"></a>[409]</span>
catch it, still less bag it and carry it away,—however it proved
that there could be no Devils and still less could there be Devils in
a man.] Spirit therefore was not more in a man than it was out of
him, the mistake arising from a misconception of the word <i>in</i>. As
for all notions of men with wings, of course they are absurd in the
extreme.</p>

<p>I return however to ‘Faust.’</p>

<p><i>F.</i> Did you ever see Shelley’s translation of the Chorus in
‘Faust’ you were just mentioning?</p>

<p><i>C.</i> I have, and admire it very much. Shelley was a man of great
power as a poet, and could he only have had some notion of order,
could you only have given him some plane whereon to stand, and
look down upon his own mind, he would have succeeded. There are
flashes of the true spirit to be met with in his works. Poor Shelley,
it is a pity I often think that I never met with him. I could have
done him good. He went to Keswick on purpose to see me and
unfortunately fell in with Southey instead. There could have been
nothing so unfortunate. Southey had no understanding for a
toleration of such principles as Shelley’s.</p>

<p>I should have laughed at his Atheism. I could have sympathised
with him and shown him that I did so, and he would have felt that
I did so. I could have shown him that I had once been in the same
state myself, and I could have guided him through it. I have often
bitterly regretted in my heart of hearts that I did never meet with
Shelley.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> It is time to be gone now I fear, Mr. Coleridge, and when I
come up again I hope you will allow me to bring a volume of Keats
with me.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> I shall be most happy to see you for any night you like to
come, and any day before 12 o’clock. Thursday nights are over now,
but any night whether Thursday or not I shall be most happy to
see you.</p>

<p><i>F.</i> I must not allow you to come out into the passage, Sir.
Good night....</p>

<p class="tb">It was nearly a hundred years ago, yet we seem to see Mr. Frere
stepping out into the night, his mind busy with the thoughts of the
last hour.</p>

<p>Were the link boys running through the streets with flaring
torches, and did the stately sedan chair carry home the gay beauty
of those far-off days?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410"></a>[410]</span></p>

<p>The picture arises which each reader can colour according to his
fancy, yet the impression left as we close the manuscript volume
with its marbled cover, is less of contrast than of unity. The matters
that were of interest in the state of the country in 1830 are of interest
in 1917, though in some cases we see the fulfilment of what was then
hoped for.</p>

<p>To-day as the Colonies send their sons in their thousands to
uphold the Motherland in her fight for Justice and Freedom, we
know that our colonial attitude has been more than justified, and
England is indeed proud of her Dominions.</p>

<p class="tb">The marble-covered volume closely written in a scholarly hand
is once more placed on the shelf. The ink has grown pale with age,
and the question arises—‘Who to-day would find time to write down
an evening’s conversation, however interesting?’ But another
question is more insistent, as we compare the popular opinion expressed
then about Keats, and other persons and subjects with the
verdict of time:</p>

<p>Can a contemporary judgment be as good as a judgment formed
when the person or matter is further from us? And this consideration
brings the consoling thought that not all that may appear
failure at the time is really failure. The age in which they live
may be unworthy of its poets and prophets, yet none the less is their
message Divine, and their voice will be heard at last.</p>

<p class="tb">But Mr. Coleridge and Mr. Frere have retired to rest, and we
shall not again disturb them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_WASTREL">‘<i>THE WASTREL.</i>’</h2>

</div>

<p>The black-faced sheep were scattering about the moss when David
Moir stopped to shut the loaning gate. It was getting dark and the
lonely fells rolled back, blurred and shadowy, to the east. In the
foreground, peat-hags showed gashes of oily black among the
ling, but some were filled with leaden water, ruffled by the bitter
wind. Beneath him, in a hollow, his small, white farmstead stood
amidst a few bare ash trees, and a dim gleam to the west indicated
the sea. Moir was gaunt and a trifle bent by age and toil, though
his eyes were keen. Sheep dealers called him a hard man, but took
his word about the flocks he sold. As a matter of fact, he lived with
stern frugality because his upland farm was poor and his younger
son’s folly had cost him dear.</p>

<p>By and by his old collie growled and he saw a line of indistinct
figures crossing the moss. As one left the rest and came towards
him he recognised a young Territorial sergeant, who was a seed
merchant’s clerk in peaceful times.</p>

<p>‘Ye’ll hae had a cauld day amang the fells,’ he remarked.
‘What were ye looking for?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know,’ the sergeant answered, smiling. ‘The idea
may have been to keep us fit, but we had orders to inquire about
the old drove road and note anything suspicious. You’ll have heard
the tales about signal lights and mysterious cars that cross the
moors after dark.’</p>

<p>‘Idle clashes!’</p>

<p>‘I’m not sure. The authorities seem to suspect that something’s
going on, and a strange motor launch has been seen off
Barennan Sands; then the old north road comes down to the shore
this way. I expect you know it?’</p>

<p>Moir nodded. The new road, which led through two towns,
followed the water of Ewan down a neighbouring valley; the old
one ran straight across the lonely fells.</p>

<p>‘It’s a green ro’d, but the maist o’ it’s no’ so bad. I hae driven
a young horse ower it in the dark, and it’s no’ verra steep until
ye rin doon to Ewan glen.’</p>

<p>‘Well,’ said the sergeant, ‘you may have a visit from Lieutenant
Jardine and his motor scouts. They start on a patrol at eight
o’clock, and, as they go round by Turnberry Moss, should get to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412"></a>[412]</span>
you about two hours later. There’s a mystery about their job,
but my notion is they’re after the strange car. Anyhow I must
catch the boys before they reach the big plantin’. They’re a
sporting lot and I don’t trust them when there’s game about.’</p>

<p>He turned away, and as Moir went down the loaning the hazy
outline of a ruined kirk on the fellside caught his eye. His only
daughter was buried in its wind-swept yard, and his two sons
had left him. Tam, who was a well-doing lad, had joined the
Borderers and been wounded in France; it was a month since
they had news of him. Jimmy had disappeared a year ago, after
Moir, who had crippled himself financially to save the lad from
arrest, disowned him. The farmer suspected that his unemotional
wife sometimes blamed him for harshness and grieved in secret
for the prodigal. She had borne with Jimmy as she had never
done with steady Tam.</p>

<p>When he entered the stone-floored, farm kitchen, Janet was
sitting near the peat fire. Her hair was whiter than Moir’s and
her face deeply lined, but her plain dress was marked by austere
taste, and she had a certain dignity. Man and wife were of the
old, stern Calvinistic type that is now dying out. The room was
large and draughty, and its precise neatness had a chilling effect.
A rag-mat, which Janet had made before rheumatism stiffened
her fingers, was the only concession to comfort, but shining china
filled a rack above the plain oak press. The hearth-irons glittered,
and a copper jelly pan flashed with an orange lustre in the glow
of the peats. The herd had gone home to his cot-house and there
was nobody else about. When Moir sat down Janet indicated a
Glasgow newspaper.</p>

<p>‘Townheid brought it ower—there’s nae news,’ she said.</p>

<p>Moir knew she had been studying the casualty list. Janet
seldom showed her feelings and he could not tell whether she was
conscious of relief or renewed suspense.</p>

<p>‘We’ll maybe get a letter soon,’ he said. ‘I met Ferguson
on the moss and he telt me Mr. Jardine is likely to be here with
his men.’</p>

<p>‘Then I’ll hae to offer them a bite to eat. There’s nae loaf-bread
and the scones are getting done; but Euphie’s coming
and she’ll help me bake.’</p>

<p>Moir looked at her thoughtfully. Euphie Black was a neighbour’s
daughter and would have married Jimmy had things gone
well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413"></a>[413]</span></p>

<p>‘Does she ever hear frae him?’</p>

<p>Janet hesitated. ‘I dinna ken; whiles I think—But I’ll
need to see if there’s enough soor milk,’ and she went off to the
dairy, while Moir sat thinking of his wastrel son.</p>

<p>Jimmy was clever and it was by his mother’s wish he went
into the Glasgow merchant’s office, but when he first came home
for the Fair holidays, Moir owned that his wife was right. Jimmy
looked well and more of a man, and his employer sent a good account
of him. On subsequent visits Moir was less satisfied. The lad’s
showy clothes offended his sober taste and he did not like his city
smartness. These, however, were not serious matters, and Janet
showed no alarm. Moir thought he could trust her judgment,
but had reflected since that her mother’s partiality had blinded her.
Then one Fair holiday Jimmy did not come home, and before the
next arrived Moir was summoned to Glasgow by the boy’s employer.
He remembered the curious glances cast at him as he walked through
the dingy office to the merchant’s private room, from which he came
out hiding a crushing load of shame behind a stern, set face. Half
an hour later he returned with a bundle of British Linen notes and
a letter of three bitter lines to be sent to the boy’s lodgings. Janet
acquiesced in his decision and never spoke of her son, but the lines
on her face had deepened.</p>

<p>By and by Euphie came in and Moir went to the stable, where
he found some harness that needed repair. He set about it and, as
he was thorough in all he did, an hour passed before he was satisfied.
When he came out it was raining hard, and on going back to the
kitchen he found the baking finished and supper ready for the patrol.
They are hospitable folk among the western fells and Lieutenant
Jardine was a nephew of Moir’s landlord’s. The farmer sat down
and watched Euphie knit. She was tall and had an attractive face,
with firmly-lined features and steady grey eyes. As a rule, she was
quiet, but her character was decided, and Moir sometimes wondered
what had drawn her to his weak son.</p>

<p>Nobody spoke. A cold wind wailed about the house and the
drips from a flooded roaning beneath the flagstone eaves splashed
against a window-pane. After a time Janet moved abruptly as
the door rattled and began to open. It had an awkward old-fashioned
latch that few strangers were able to lift. The door,
however, had opened and an indistinct figure stood, hesitating, in
the porch. Janet got up and beckoned, but Moir sat still with
his mouth set.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414"></a>[414]</span></p>

<p>A young man came in, the water running from his light overcoat,
and mud splashed about his leggings. He was breathless,
but his face was rather pale than hot, and as he approached the
lamp Moir saw there was blood upon his sleeve. The lad said
nothing, but Janet went to meet him and put her arms round his
neck. She felt him wince at her embrace, and, drawing back, saw,
for the first time, his torn and reddened sleeve. Then with a low,
pitiful cry she led him forward to the fire.</p>

<p>‘Come away while I see til yere arm. How got ye hurt?’</p>

<p>Jimmy looked at his father, who made no sign, and afterwards
at Euphie with a shamefaced air. She did not speak, but gave him
a quiet, friendly smile that offended Moir. It was not for nothing
he had disowned his son, and now the women had, without asking
a question, re-instated him. Janet helped the lad to take off his
wet coat, which he dropped upon the floor, and then, after telling
Euphie to bring hot water, took him away.</p>

<p>Euphie sat down silently when she returned, and Moir, who
disliked untidiness, picked up the coat and, after washing the sleeve,
hung it near the door. By and by mother and son came back, but
Jimmy now wore a different suit that Moir remembered. It was
an old one he had once left behind, but Janet had cleaned and
pressed it and kept it for three years. Moir began to realise that
he did not know his wife yet. He turned to Euphie when Jimmy
sat down without looking at him.</p>

<p>‘It’s getting late and ye’d be better at home,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘No,’ she answered with firm quietness. ‘I was promised to
Jimmy and I’ll hear what he has to tell.’</p>

<p>Moir made a sign of acquiescence and gave his son a stern
commanding look.</p>

<p>‘What brought ye here?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘I was hurt and had nowhere else to go,’ Jimmy answered in a
strained voice. ‘I only want shelter for a few hours; not to
stay.’</p>

<p>‘How did ye get hurt?’</p>

<p>‘A Territorial stopped me at a gate. He tore my arm with his
bayonet, but the cut’s not very deep.’</p>

<p>‘Ye were hard put to it when ye tried to pass the soldier,’ Moir
remarked.</p>

<p>‘I had to pass him. It was very dark, and there was a hole in
the dyke not far off. I thought the others were after me.’</p>

<p>‘What ithers? But ye’ll go back and begin at the first o’ it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415"></a>[415]</span>
I sent ye the price o’ a third-class passage to Canada. Why did
ye not go?’</p>

<p>‘The money was stolen.’</p>

<p>‘Ay,’ said Moir grimly, ‘I will not ask ye where! Gang on.’</p>

<p>Jimmy hesitated, but pulled himself together and told his tale.
Soon after he was left penniless and disgraced, he found a friend
in Fritz, one of the boon companions who had brought about his
downfall. Fritz lent him a few small sums and by and by took
him to see another man, who sent him to Leith. Jimmy did not
mention what he did there, but stated awkwardly that he had got
in too deep to draw back when he found out what his employer’s
business really was. Then he stopped and said his arm was hurting
him. The women looked puzzled, but Moir’s face set like flint.</p>

<p>‘So ye stayed and helped the Gairman spies!’</p>

<p>There was silence for a few moments. Euphie’s face was flushed
and she fixed her eyes on the fire, while Janet nervously moved
her hands.</p>

<p>‘Weel,’ Moir resumed, ‘ye can noo tell us how ye cam’ to visit
this pairt o’ the country.’</p>

<p>Jimmy roused himself with an effort and went on in a low voice:
‘I came with them in the car now and then, by the old green road;
you see I knew the way. They met another party at the waterfoot
by Barennan Sands.’</p>

<p>‘Just that!’ Moir said grimly. ‘I ken why ye went to Leith.
There was news to be picked up aboot the navy yards at Rosyth.
What else did ye bring?’</p>

<p>‘Sometimes a man I didn’t know, and once a load of small
iron drums. I can’t say what was inside. They didn’t tell me
much.’</p>

<p>Moir pondered. He imagined that the drums held something
that was needed by enemy submarines; but Jimmy’s frankness
puzzled him. He did not think it was contrition, since he had no
faith in his son. The lad seemed to have told the truth because he
was afraid.</p>

<p>‘Where did ye leave yere foreign friends?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘Where the road turns off to the old place of Whiterigg; they
stopped there now and then, and there’s a gate, you mind. I got
down to open it and they drove off.’</p>

<p>‘Why?’ Moir demanded, and the fear was plainer in Jimmy’s
eyes.</p>

<p>‘I think their work must be nearly done and they meant to get<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416"></a>[416]</span>
rid of me. After all, I don’t know very much, and they’d reckon
I’d be afraid to tell what I had found out.’</p>

<p>Moir began to understand. The old house at Whiterigg had
lately been left in charge of a caretaker who obviously belonged to
the gang, which indicated that the latter was well organised.
The lad was perhaps in some danger from them.</p>

<p>‘But what for did they gang to the Whiterigg?’</p>

<p>‘To wait for high-tide, I expect. They’d run down to the waterfoot
when a boat could come up the gut through the sands.’</p>

<p>‘That would be the way o’ it, nae doot; but I dinna ken yet
why ye cam’ hame.’</p>

<p>‘Where else would he gang for safety?’ Janet asked in a pitiful
tone.</p>

<p>‘Ony place but here! It’s to my sorrow he’s a son o’ mine. But
let him speak.’</p>

<p>Jimmy’s narrative was not very lucid, but it appeared that he
had been seized by a kind of panic when left in the road. He had
very little money, something suspicious had happened at the last
stopping place, and he thought his friends had betrayed him to
the police, or might send somebody after him in the dark. He lost
his nerve when he found the soldier in his way, and after getting
past the man ran blindly across the moor towards home. When
he finished Moir glanced at the tall oak clock.</p>

<p>‘Ye have aboot an ’oor, and then Mr. Jardine will be here with
his motor scouts,’ he said, and taking his gun from a rack went
out.</p>

<p>It was raining hard and very dark, but he made his way across
the moss to where the old road ran down to Ewan Water, and
stopped a short distance from the bank. A weak thorn hedge grew
beside it, but Moir could see the pale glimmer of the water two or
three yards below and hear the gurgle of the current, which swirled
round a deep elbow-pool. A pair of stone gateposts stood close
by, but the gate had been removed to allow the cattle fresh pasture,
and Moir, who knew where it was, brought it back. He hung it to
the post and fastened it firmly to the other with some wire from a
fence. He had already lighted a lantern, and now examined his
work. The gate was old, but looked pretty strong; some force
would be required to break it down. Then he went up the steep
hill away from the water and stopped at an opening in a dyke at
the top. There was no gate here, and after hiding his lantern he
sheltered behind the wall in a dangerous mood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417"></a>[417]</span></p>

<p>David Moir was a true descendant of the old Westland Whigs;
sternly just and ready to suffer for his principles, he could make no
allowance for a different point of view, and was subject to fits of
cold anger which, while generally righteous, was tinged with fanaticism.
His son’s treachery filled him with horror, but he was calm
enough to see that the weak lad had been the victim of the men who
used him. Well, he meant to settle the black account with them!</p>

<p>It was bitterly cold and he was getting wet, but his watchfulness
did not relax. The growl of Ewan Water, brawling among the
stones, rose from the valley and the wind whistled eeriely through
the chinks in the dyke. For a time he heard nothing else, and
then a faint throbbing began and grew louder. A big car, without
lights, was travelling dangerously fast along the fellside, and as it
came near Moir stood in the gateway holding up his lantern. He
heard a warning shout and a rattle of stones as the locked wheels
skidded, and the half-seen car stopped a few yards off. Moir turned
the light upon the two men in it.</p>

<p>‘Which o’ ye is Fritz?’ he asked.</p>

<p>They looked surprised, but one said ‘You want to know too
much. Why have you stopped us?’</p>

<p>‘My name is Moir. I want a word with ye.’</p>

<p>He put the lantern on the dyke and the light glimmered on the
barrel of his gun. It was his duty to hand the men to the patrol,
but if this was impossible, so much the worse for them. They
had made his son a traitor to his country by taking advantage of
his need, and Moir suspected that Fritz had first made him a
thief.</p>

<p>‘You’re the young fool’s father, but we can’t waste time on you,’
said one. ‘Drop that gun and let us pass!’</p>

<p>‘Get doon!’ said Moir, who did not move.</p>

<p>‘Out of the way, or we’ll drive over you!’ the other cried.</p>

<p>The car rolled forward and Moir sprang back, hesitated as it
ran past, and lowered his gun.</p>

<p>‘Drive tae h—, where ye belang!’ he said, as the car lurched
furiously down the hill.</p>

<p>Then he stood and listened. A sharp-pitched throbbing now
rose from the valley, through which the high-road wound on the
other side of the water. It sounded like a motor bicycle, and Moir
understood the impatience of the men he had stopped. Jardine’s
scouts had got upon their track, but the chances were against the
fugitives reaching the bridge where the roads joined. He waited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418"></a>[418]</span>
with his face fixed like stone until he heard a heavy crash in the
dark below. Then he picked up his lantern and ran down the
hill.</p>

<p>When he reached the bottom everything was quiet except for
the roar of Ewan Water and the hum of the approaching bicycle,
but pieces of the broken gate lay about the road. Moir raised
the lantern and saw a track deeply ploughed through the grass
and stones, in front of which the hedge was smashed. Looking
down through the gap, he distinguished something in the water.
It looked like the wheel of an upset car, but he could not see it
well, because the torrent foamed in an angry swirl across what lay
below. If the men had not jumped before the plunge, it was too
late for help.</p>

<p>A minute later, the motor bicycle rattled across the bridge a
short distance off and sped towards him. It slowed and Lieutenant
Jardine got down.</p>

<p>‘Have you seen a car, David?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘I hae,’ said Moir. ‘Let yere machine stand. She’s in the
pool.’</p>

<p>The young man followed him to the broken hedge and looked
down. ‘What about the men?’</p>

<p>‘Maybe they jumpit aff. If no’, they’re under her.’</p>

<p>Lieutenant Jardine, who had seen no active service yet, caught
his breath with a short gasp.</p>

<p>‘How long will it take to get her out?’</p>

<p>‘An ’oor or two and half a dizzen men; but ye’ll need to send
doon the bay for tackle.’</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid that’s so,’ agreed Jardine, who had got a shock.
‘However, we’d better see if they’ve escaped and are somewhere
about.’</p>

<p>They searched the hedge and bank on both sides, but found
nobody, nor any footprints leading from the water. Then Jardine
followed Moir to where the shattered gate lay about the road.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ he said slowly, ‘it was justifiable; you warned them
to stop. A herd told us about the car and I started at once. After
a time I thought I heard her in front, but suppose I missed her
where the old road branches off. But some of the boys will have
reached your farm, and we must send for tackle.’</p>

<p>He left the bicycle and resumed as they walked up the hill:
‘When we stopped at the Mains farm, I sent out flankers to search
the by-roads ahead, by way of training the men. One reported<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419"></a>[419]</span>
that he challenged and wounded a suspicious stranger who refused
to stop and managed to get away. I sent him and another on to
search the country and report to me at your house. It looks as
if the fellow had something to do with the car.’</p>

<p>‘Ay,’ Moir answered quietly, ‘it looks like that.’</p>

<p>He said nothing further, for his mind was occupied. His duty
was to give up his son, but he thought of the lad’s mother and
shrank. Still, he would not shield him; if Jimmy was in the house
when they reached it, justice must take its course. His heart
beat fast as he opened the door and then he drew a breath of
relief. A few men in wet khaki sat by the hearth, talking to Janet
and Euphie, but Jimmy was not there. Moir thought his wife’s
look was somewhat strained, but when she turned towards him the
girl’s glance was steady. The men got up as Jardine came forward,
and he sent one off to obtain appliances for dragging out the car.</p>

<p>‘Did you get on the track of the fellow you wounded?’ he
asked another.</p>

<p>‘No, sir. I took the moss road without a light, but the machine
went ower a big stone and threw me off. The front wheel was
buckled, so I left her behind a peat-stack and cam’ on, without
seeing anybody.’</p>

<p>‘Has Watson been in to report?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir. He kept the high-road, by the Knowe and Townhead,
but they’d seen nothing o’ our man, and there was nobody on the
road as far as where the drove track runs in. Watson’s gone back
to watch by the bothy near the brig.’</p>

<p>‘Then it looks as if the fellow was hiding between where he was
seen and here, but it’s unlikely that a wounded man would lie out
on the moors on a night like this,’ Jardine said thoughtfully, and
turned to Janet. ‘He might have crept into your byre or barn.
Did you hear anything suspicious?’</p>

<p>Moir was sensible of keen tension as he glanced at his wife, but
her face was calm.</p>

<p>‘He couldna have creepit into ony place withoot Rab, the
collie, hearing him.’</p>

<p>‘The dog was outside and he’ll hardly let a stranger set foot
in the loaning,’ Euphie supported her.</p>

<p>‘That’s true, sir,’ one of the men remarked. ‘He cam’ oot
to meet us and it was no’ that easy getting by.’</p>

<p>Jardine hesitated, and Moir felt his heart beat as he glanced at
Jimmy’s coat, which hung in plain view with the wet sleeve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420"></a>[420]</span>
suspiciously torn. Nobody, however, seemed to have noticed it, and
when Janet urged them Jardine and his scouts sat down to supper.
When the meal was over and they were going, Moir said:</p>

<p>‘I’ll hae to drive a son o’ mine, frae Glasgow, doon the water
to catch the early train.’</p>

<p>‘Then Jimmy’s back?’ said Jardine, who knew something
about the lad.</p>

<p>‘He got hame late and needit a few ’oors’ sleep before starting
again,’ Janet explained.</p>

<p>‘Very well,’ said Jardine, who took out a fountain pen and
writing on a leaf from his pocket-book gave it Moir. ‘My men
won’t interfere with you, but as I must warn the police and Territorials,
you’d better take this pass.’</p>

<p>He went out and Moir turned to Janet. ‘Where hae ye hidden
him?’</p>

<p>‘In the barn,’ said Janet, with signs of strain.</p>

<p>‘Then ye’ll baith come and hear what I say til him,’ Moir
replied, and lighted his lantern.</p>

<p>A minute or two later, Jimmy got up from the straw among
which he was lying, as Moir flashed the light into his face.</p>

<p>‘Have they gone?’ he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>‘Ay,’ said Moir; ‘but ye’re no’ safe yet. If yere Gairman
friends arena’ drooned, they’ll be in jail the morn.’</p>

<p>‘Then they’ll think I gave them away.’</p>

<p>‘It’s verra probable,’ Moir agreed. ‘For a’ that, ye’ll be in
Carlisle by then to enlist in the Borderers.’</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment, and then Euphie said ‘It’s
the only way, Jimmy. It’s your chance of winning back.’</p>

<p>‘He’ll tak’ it,’ Moir remarked grimly. ‘If he doesna, he leaves
here in chairge o’ the polis.’ Then he turned to the lad. ‘I’ll
waken ye when it’s time. Dinna’ keep yere mither lang.’</p>

<p>He went back to the kitchen, and by and by Janet came in alone.
Her eyes were wet, but she put her hand on Moir’s shoulder.</p>

<p>‘I’m thinking ye found the right way, David,’ she said. ‘He’ll
gang.’</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ON_NIGHT_DUTY"><i>ON NIGHT DUTY.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>It was a large base hospital in a large and dirty town. South
Country men grew frank with disgust when they saw the pall of
fog that hung for a fortnight outside the windows, yet things were
little better when the fog cleared and the great buildings stood
stark in their black ugliness.</p>

<p>Yet the night nurses would linger at the corridor windows on
their way down to the dining-room. There was the glamour of
night on the big city, mighty buildings silhouetted against a sky
of dark luminous blue, towers that divided the stars, and far below
in the street the ruby and topaz lights of the road-menders, with
the glowing brazier of the night-watchman. And then dawn came
with its chilling wind and its grey cheerless light that discovered,
without love or pity, the sordid things of town—the dirty canal,
the barges, the heaps of timber, the ugly money-making warehouses
and factories. All this we saw—a world pallid and cold, with
none of the genial glow of noontide.</p>

<p>The hospital never failed to charm me at night. Its interior
aspect had a beauty of dim wards and red subdued lights over the
‘dug-outs,’ where a sister or nurse sat in charge. The long rows of
white beds disappeared into the darkness, and the men in them had
that pathos—unreal in some cases—of the sleeping and the helpless.
At night they were all children—children who talked pitifully in
their sleep of Germans and trenches and ghastly things beyond our
ken. They called sometimes a woman’s name and professed next
morning a guileless ignorance of her existence.</p>

<p>It was a hushed and mysterious world, where one whispered
and walked stealthily, and yet where much was told and where life
seemed simpler and more genuine than by day when the little tin
gods were all awake. At that time I saw most of the mental ward,
the most pathetic place in any hospital. Sleep was an unwilling
visitor there, except to the orderlies, who, in the intervals of card-playing
and button-cleaning, relapsed into the attitudes of the
seven sleepers.</p>

<p>Night after night old Dad Hobson would stay awake till two
or three o’clock, without complaint or murmur. Any man a little
past his prime was called ‘dad’ or described as ‘old’ in this land
of youth. And in sober fact Dad Hobson had seven children. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422"></a>[422]</span>
had been a miner before he made the great sacrifice that had left
him maimed and insane. He was always courteous, always considerate.
Even on those days when he refused to eat it was with a
polite ‘I’m sorry not to oblige you, nurse.’ He believed himself
guilty of some crime—he had murdered Sir Ian Hamilton—and in
trivial ways too he held himself responsible for any disturbance in
that much-disturbed ward. At times he was so much better that
we hoped he was regaining his wits, but always there would come a
relapse and his face would be downcast, and ‘I’m puzzled someway,
something’s wrong. I can’t get things clear in my mind,’ would be
the explanation. He had odd delusions too, for a doctor clad
in a dressing-gown provoked his question to an orderly, ‘Is that
Lord Nelson?’</p>

<p>It was a strange little party altogether in that ward. Hobson
would lie there by the hour, dimly annoyed by Jimmy in the bed
opposite. Jimmy had nearly died of wounds and later of pneumonia,
but he had rallied, only to reach a state of discomfort and
nervous temper that was liable to fiendish explosions. For the
most part he was a lovable boy, with a curious charm of his own.
Sleepless, like Hobson, till the small hours, he played cards with the
orderlies. When things pleased him Jimmy was an angel, but at
other times he was a fiend. A certain soldier, a clarionet player
once in the Queen’s Hall orchestra, came to the ward. He was
suffering from insomnia and melancholia. Jimmy’s drawling voice
and his card-playing and, perhaps, his popularity annoyed the
clarionet player, and they quarrelled. Jimmy merely remarked:</p>

<p>‘I’ll do for him—see if I don’t.’</p>

<p>The clarionet player was removed to the next ward, separated
from the other only by a glass and wood partition.</p>

<p>‘He shan’t sleep to-night if I don’t,’ said Jimmy, and he took
careful aim at the glass partition with his tin mug. He hit the
woodwork and missed his enemy’s head in the next ward, so he
fell into heavy-browed sulking, with the threat ‘I’ll do for myself.’
This is often a mere threat, but he did make an endeavour by biting
up a blue-lead pencil—a tedious and uncertain form of suicide.
The pencil was taken away and, blue-lipped and weary, like a
naughty child he fell asleep. Poor Jimmy! He went to a Scottish
asylum where many of our patients were sent for further treatment.
I heard lately that he was really better and likely to be discharged.</p>

<p>One of the beds was occupied by Andy—Andy of the picturesque
speech and uncertain behaviour. He came in raging under the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423"></a>[423]</span>
effects of alcoholic poisoning. Such cases always spent a night
or so in the X-ray room with a special orderly. I saw him that
night, a flushed unhappy-looking boy, who was sane enough to
speak politely and to say ‘Nurrse,’ with the delightful roll that
our Jocks put into it. Later Andy came down to the ward, and was
duly established in a corner bed. Here we got to know him for
the loquacious rattle-pate he was. By day he was sane enough,
but at night he was subject to awful dreams and fits of horror,
which caused him to roll out of bed with an alarming bump. One
night he thought the German prisoners were coming to murder
him—two inoffensive boys with very little strength between them;
another time I found him a hump at the foot of his bed.</p>

<p>‘Come out, Andy,’ I said.</p>

<p>‘I’ll kill you if I do, Nurrse; I’ve killed all my chums.’</p>

<p>But he crawled out flushed and weary. His face was coarsened
and weakened by too much drinking, but it was a pleasant boyish
face. He had, too, that quick imagination which gives vivid
charm even to stories which tax belief. Andy told us wonderful
stories of his doings at Loos and elsewhere. He had been a bomb-thrower,
one of three survivors from a party of one hundred and
sixty. The story was declared to be untrue by someone who knew
him, but Andy could spin a yarn to keep Sister B., the orderlies,
and myself in amazement round his bed. His own history, too,
was a chequered, strange record. He had run away from home at
ten years old and had joined a circus. He had been with Barnum,
Wombwell, ‘Lord’ George Sanger, and travelled the kingdom from
town to town. At fifteen he had enlisted in the Cameron Highlanders,
deserted after a time, changed his name and joined the
Gordons. He had been a champion boxer for—I forget the place.
He had been everywhere and done most things, and was—poor
Andy!—a nervous, dyspeptic wreck at twenty-four. Yet he had
‘a way with him’—a way that made us fond and disapproving
at the same time.</p>

<p>The night before I started for a holiday, the Sister in charge
had given orders that Andy was to wear pyjamas. He preferred
a night-shirt. The point made a dispute. To humour him I said:</p>

<p>‘Andy, you’ll spoil my holiday if you don’t put on those trousers.
I couldn’t be happy if I thought you hadn’t got them on.’</p>

<p>Andy was on the far side of a screen. There was silence, then
a rustling, then Andy’s voice: ‘Nurrse ... I’ve got on they
trrousers. I wouldn’t spoil your holiday, you ken.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424"></a>[424]</span></p>

<p>The next morning I saw the last of him. He was asleep. I put
my hand on his head and said ‘Tell him I left him my blessing.’
It was carelessly said; I thought I should find him when I came
back, but I have never seen him since.</p>

<p>They sent an armed escort from Aberdeen to bring Andy to a
court-martial. Rumour went round the hospital that he had
deserted in France, and would be sent back to France to be shot.
How often in his sleep Andy had muttered ‘I won’t go back;
I won’t.... I won’t.... I’ll do for myself first. They shan’t
court-martial me ... they shan’t.’ Now it was explained.</p>

<p>When Andy heard that the escort had come for him he was
quiet enough. He promised to pack his kit-bag and go quietly.
However, he went off to the bathroom and was found trying to
hang himself. They brought him back to the ward. He snatched
a razor from his locker and tried to cut his throat. I don’t think
he tried very hard—Andy was more dramatic than thorough.
The escort went back to Aberdeen, for Andy was now in one of his
raving, struggling attacks, and obviously unfit for the journey.
When he was better he was handcuffed, his hands behind him,
and so left for more hours than one likes to think of. I heard the
story when I came back, and there was a chorus of pity on his
behalf.</p>

<p>‘I could have cried when I saw him handcuffed, marching down
the corridor,’ said a nurse. And the orderlies, even one whom he
had kicked in the stomach, were pitiful for him—orderlies are a
compassionate race.</p>

<p>The escort returned and Andy, strapped to a stretcher, was taken
away to Aberdeen. We discussed his fate for many days, always
with the decision ‘They <i>couldn’t</i> shoot him.’ Then rumour said he
would get five years in a military prison, but meanwhile Andy sent
us letters, written in lurid-looking red ink. He wrote from a Scottish
hospital, and wrote gaily, jauntily, with no mention of prisons,
desertion, or court-martial. His pride must have suffered horribly,
for he had made of himself so gallant a figure, poor boastful Andy.
He loved to write in the dialect that he talked, though he could,
if he chose, send a fine English letter. Speaking of his very delicate
digestion he says ‘I had a wee bit jelly for dinner; it slipped itself
doon and just slipped back again. It doesna matter, what they gie
me, it comes back. I try hard to keep it, but I canna.’ A few
letters came from the large Scottish asylum where many of our
mental cases were sent. They were always written in red ink, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425"></a>[425]</span>
concluded with a liberal supply of kisses (a matter of politeness
this with many soldiers). Then the letters stopped, and none of us
has heard anything more of poor Andy. He belonged, I fear, to
the flotsam of life, and the waves washed him here and there.</p>

<p>A sad case was poor old Snakes. He was called Snakes because
when he recovered enough to speak, he told us that he had swallowed
a lot of snakes—no wonder that he never smiled. One morning
I put the conventional question, ‘Are you better to-day?’ and received
the sad answer, ‘How can I be better, I’m full of buttons.’
Another time he was full of watches that ticked in his ears,
and again he had swallowed a tramcar—poor, melancholy old
Snakes!</p>

<p>But the dearest of all our sad little family was certainly Alfred;
Alfred Morgan of a Welsh regiment, never mind which. He was
brought in from a military prison—sentenced for desertion, a case
for a certain paper that champions the injured Tommy. Poor
Alfred, with his wits all gone to pieces, his head and limbs shaking,
his face working, seemed to us a living protest against any judgment
but a doctor’s. I could hardly bear to see him, so hopelessly
insane did he look. Death would have been far better than this
doddering idiocy. The other men, sanest of the sane compared
with him, tried to pet him and to coax answers out of him, but his
mind, as Sister B. remarked, was a jig-saw puzzle gone to pieces.
The pieces seemed to have no cohesion. He talked ramblingly of
Bob his horse, of a dog, a canal, some medals, a picture, of Ada and
the pigeons. He fancied the floor was the canal, and fished there
with groping hands. Sometimes a word or a place-name would
seem to rouse him, and he’d tell us the names of streets or of people:
at other times he would shake his head and gaze vacantly round
him, or look with that worried, bewildered look that made one’s
heart ache.</p>

<p>It was Sister B. who did the most to fit the puzzle together.
Every night she would sit by his bed and question him, bringing
him back to the point time after time. We were filling in more
of the puzzle every night. Alfred had lived in Birmingham, had
been on a canal barge, had taken coal to some place; he had won
medals, had a mother, and there was a picture that he remembered.
Policemen excited him to frenzy, and when he saw one of the Force
he would fling apples or slippers, or any handy missile, through
the window. He could play cards too. There was a gradual
mental development—the most fascinating thing one can watch.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426"></a>[426]</span>
But it was slow, and Alfred seemed like a rudderless boat at sea
till he met Jock.</p>

<p>Jock is a story all to himself. Suffice it to say of him that his
vocation was to be a guardian angel. Every Scottish soldier is
Jock in hospital, and perhaps other hospitals have found Jocks
like ours—always unselfish, cheery, uncomplaining, infinitely
pitiful to every trouble but their own; still I believe our Jock
would outshine theirs.</p>

<p>Sister B. decided to bring Alfred on a visit to Jock’s ward.
I must say that the experiment was painful. A surgical ward is a
very cheerful place, and poor Alfred, shaky, bewildered, pitiful,
was a figure to darken the sun at that time. But Sister B. was a
nurse of brave experiments. She dared and succeeded; she was
resourceful and passionately interested in her patients. So she
brought Alfred to this sane and happy ward, and sat him down
by Jock’s bed. Jock had been wounded at Loos in September,
1915, and had remained in bed for eight months with the occasional
variation of an operation and brief respites when he was
up and in a wheeled chair.</p>

<p>Among many pathetic things I had seen, none seemed to me
more pathetic than the sight of those two war-shattered boys
together. Alfred, nearly speechless, his poor wits all astray, tried
to make himself lucid, while Jock, with infinite pity on his face, tried
to understand and to help. The one looked like an angel of mercy,
the other like some poor soul in search of peace. I don’t know
how they talked, but somehow they made friends. Alfred was
utterly unwilling to go back to his own ward, though he returned
laden with cigarettes and apples. From that day the friendship
grew. Every day Alfred visited Jock, and Jock, when he could
get into a chair, returned the call. Somehow they talked. Jock
has infinite patience and tact; he has graduated in the college of
suffering and has learnt the whole art of compassion. He found
out that Alfred knew most things knowable about football, that
he was, in fact, a ‘real little sport.’</p>

<p>The ward adopted Alfred as a sort of mascot; he might do
and have what he liked. He was just an unhappy child, humoured
at all points.</p>

<p>Then arrived someone who solved the riddle of the medals
and the picture of which Alfred talked so much. This man had
seen a picture of Alfred boxing another celebrated pugilist. Alfred
was a well-known character in the Ring—he had won his nine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427"></a>[427]</span>
medals in various contests. To name a boxer was to set Alfred
blazing with excitement and fearful efforts to stammer out some
story of an encounter in which he had taken part.</p>

<p>We learnt more of Ada at last. Ada was ‘his girl,’ and he
had left the pigeons in her keeping.</p>

<p>‘Poor Ada,’ I said one day to Jock, ‘what would she say if
she saw Alfred?’</p>

<p>‘Alfred writes to her,’ Jock replied solemnly. ‘At least I
write for him.’</p>

<p>‘But,’ I objected, ‘Ada may fall in love with your letters—it’s
not fair to her.’</p>

<p>‘Oh! I put “Jock helped to write this” at the top,’ he
explained earnestly.</p>

<p>What Ada thought of these dual letters I cannot say. I suppose
she minds Alfred’s pigeons and hopes on. As for Alfred, I think
his real love was for Jock. When he was restive and talked of
going away we could soothe him by saying that he surely would not
leave Jock alone. Everything he had he brought to his idol to
share it with him. He made himself bath-chairman, and the two
would go off to the one window that commanded an amusing
street view. Together they hung out in perfect amity and understood
each other in silence, for Alfred could barely get the words for
even a short sentence. Alfred was the sheep-dog, Jock the shepherd.</p>

<p>It was understood that if one was asked to tea anywhere the
other must go too. With Jock Alfred was known to be ‘all right.’
So things went happily until the inevitable parting. Jock was sent
to a Red Cross hospital almost at a moment’s notice. Alfred was
inconsolable; he wandered, red-eyed, forlorn, piteously incoherent,
from ward to ward, searching vaguely and vainly for his chum.
He shed bitter childlike tears, while Jock, for his part, suffered for
Alfred’s trouble and his own. Such is the pathos of hospital.
Later, Alfred was sent to the Scottish hospital of which mention
has been made. He and Jock write to each other—perhaps some
day they will meet.</p>

<p>As for Jock, I think a star laughed when he was born—though
he can suffer to the full capacity of a Celtic nature. Good angels
have him in their keeping and save him—only Heaven knows how—from
being spoilt.</p>

<p>I was present when the sergeant of the guard met Jock
being wheeled down the corridor. He interrupted the triumphal
progress with six foot of stalwart manhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428"></a>[428]</span></p>

<p>‘That,’ said he, ‘is by his looks the happiest boy in this hospital.
I’ve never seen him sad, I’ve never heard him grumble. He’s
the boy for my money—he’s a good boy, a great boy! We need
more like him, we do!’</p>

<p>This was embarrassing, but Jock took it quietly and politely.
More touching was the devotion of the corporal of the guard.
‘I had a son just like him, killed at Suvla Bay,’ he explained.</p>

<p>But Jock was of those who have fairy godmothers. If you
imagine Bonnie Prince Charlie before his heroism was tarnished,
you have Jock; or if you imagine Malcolm, Marquis of Lossie,
in a lighter vein, you have him; and if you picture young Lochinvar,
or Jock of Hazeldean, or some other hero of Scottish ballad,
you see our Jock.</p>

<p>When first we saw him—it was an October day soon after the
battle of Loos—he looked haggard, unshaven, and quite unlike
the boy of a later date. He had a shockingly wounded knee, and
was running a temperature. His dressing was a daily torture.
We knew it was agony, because he whistled and sang the whole time
and talked the most fascinating nonsense in beautiful Doric—only
he gripped the head rail of his bed with an iron ‘grup,’ as he would
have called it, and looked within measurable distance of fainting.</p>

<p>Movement was dreadful to him, but he had journeys to the
X-ray room and to the operating theatre. Even in semi-consciousness
he was true to himself—true to the self which was
always pushed out of sight. I remember his sitting up just after
an operation, and casting a distracted look round the ward.</p>

<p>‘Are the troops safe and in their places?’ he asked wildly.
Reassured, he asked again ‘Is Paddy all right?’ Paddy was our
orderly and a devoted friend of Jock’s. Then with a sigh of relief
he lay down.</p>

<p>The following day he had an extension put on the injured leg.
If you can imagine what it is to have a terribly injured knee, then
to have it cut about, and finally to have it held up for half an hour
or more while the extension is put on, you have just a faint idea
what Jock suffered in grim silence. He was in the torture chamber
but he never winced—only the youth went out of his face and a
sort of grey old age seemed to come upon him.</p>

<p>I said to him later: ‘You’ve had an awful time of it to-day,
Jock.’</p>

<p>He was still faint with pain, but he murmured: ‘No so bad.
Oh! it was no so bad at all, Nurse.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429"></a>[429]</span></p>

<p>To these bad times belonged his polite requests, ‘Will you pull
my leg a wee?’ and ‘Will you sort my leg?’—a phrase which
always delighted me; but, as a Scottish captain asked seriously
when I had quoted this latter request, ‘What else <i>could</i> he have
said?’</p>

<p>Often in those bad winter days when Jock’s temperature rose
with such alarming bounds, I used to wonder if he would ever see
Scotland again. There was the dreadful bugbear septicæmia, and
there was always the likelihood that he would have to lose his leg.
But he had a good angel in Sister B. No one could ‘sort his leg’
as she could, no one could hurt him so little or so quickly as she,
and no one could put in what he called ‘they tubes’ as she could—those
deadly tubes that seemed to go by winding alleys and narrow
desperate ways under his patella and right through the back of
his knee. I think she staked her soul (and no one gave more life
and soul to her patients than she did) that Jock should keep
his leg. She was the first who dared to get him into a wheel chair;
she taught him to walk again; she comforted him and helped him
to face the long months, for even Jock had his dark days—more
of them than he let us know. He used at these times to read Burns
with devotion, and he told me that ‘Desolation’ and ‘Man is
made to Mourn’ were his favourite poems, and exactly expressive
of his feelings.</p>

<p>‘One gets a wee bit fed up at times,’ he confessed, ‘thinking
one’ll never play football again.’</p>

<p>Football had been his joy, and somehow I think he went out
to the war as to football on a larger scale. Quite casually he described
the Highlanders’ charge at Loos. He was out of it very
soon himself, but even at that moment his thoughts had all been
outside himself.</p>

<p>‘I prayed then as I never prayed before,’ he remarked.</p>

<p>‘For the stretcher-bearers to come to you,’ suggested a listener.</p>

<p>‘No, of course not’—this with surprise—‘I prayed for the
boys. Man! it was grand to see the kilts go by.’</p>

<p>Casually he told of his effort to save one of his officers who was
severely wounded. But both of them were unable to move and
they lay on the field for twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Patrick MacGill in his terrible description of Loos tells how
the Jocks were scattered, dead and wounded, on the battlefield,
their bare knees gleaming in the pale morning light. But for many
there was no return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430"></a>[430]</span></p>

<p>However, this is a happy story. I firmly believe that Jock is
the true fairy-tale hero who marries the princess and lives happily
ever afterwards, even as he deserves. But he will always suffer
for the suffering of others. He confided to me with shame that
certain books brought him inexplicable sensations rather like wanting
to cry. ‘It’s a sort of soft spot in my wooden heart,’ he explained.
All alone in the ward he would solace himself by singing Burns’s
songs—with tears in his eyes. He accounted for them by saying
the light had dazzled him.</p>

<p>To the sorrows of the ward he gave all his heart. One of the
ineffaceable memories of hospital is the morning when Patterson
died. Patterson, a man of very different temperament, had loved
Jock too and had, during his long-drawn weeks of dying, found
comfort, I believe, in the atmosphere of cheeriness that emanated
from Jock’s bed, when he could not move. They were two of
the worst cases, and they could only exchange greetings by shouting
across the ward.</p>

<p>On this morning there was a terrible silence. No one had the
heart for song or gramophone. Patterson’s pain was too apparent;
the coming end of it held the men in a hushed suspense. Then
suddenly Patterson made an effort and called to Jock, ‘How
are you, Jock?’ And Jock, white with sympathy, called back,
‘Champion! What way are you, Patterson?’ The pity of
it....</p>

<p>But Jock’s story is only a quarter written. Its chapters have
been fine reading for those who have had the luck to read them
so far, but I believe there will be finer chapters yet.</p>

<p>Often I said to myself in fear for him, ‘Whom the orderlies
love die young’—for the orderlies adored Jock, but the adapted
proverb did not come true, for he is walking about now and ‘enjoying
life fine to make up for all the months in bed—not that
I suffered so much at all, Nurse.’</p>

<p>This is a happy story, but we saw sad ones.</p>

<p>Death is just an incident in hospital life. Alas! one sometimes
forgets that it is all-important to the dying. A household seems
to hold its breath when somebody dies; a ward continues its
automatic routine. There is pity—much of it—but it is a common-sense
pity, that accepts death as just an inevitable happening to
be finished and then forgotten.</p>

<p>I remember so well the night when old Sergeant Meadows
died. He had only been in the ward for three days, so that his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431"></a>[431]</span>
personality had had no chance to impress us. All the men settled
down to sleep except Harman, who had suddenly gone mad. He
shrieked if anyone went near him, tried to push us away, then to
blow us away. A hypodermic of morphia seemed to produce
little effect on him except that he was a shade quieter; he did not
sleep but remained sitting up in bed, watchful and terribly alert.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the poor old sergeant was dying. Nothing could
be done for him. Morton, the orderly, always pitiful, came and
looked at him.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ he said philosophically, ‘this is a queer night we’re
having. A man in the other ward tells me ’e’s been seein’ rabbits.
It’s too much! I just says “This must stop. There’s too many
seein’ rabbits to-night.” I knew a man what saw red, white, and
blue rats—had ’em proper, ’e did.’</p>

<p>Morton sighed. He was a gentle soul, capable of infinite tenderness
and patience, as many orderlies are. They are, one sometimes
thinks, gentler than women, less conventional, and stereotyped
in their kindness.</p>

<p>‘Poor man!’ Morton murmured. ‘A good old soul. It’s
queer how little one thinks of it. When the young ones die it
comes worse on one.’</p>

<p>A few minutes afterwards the sergeant was dead. Unused to
death, I hardly realised it. At once preparations were made for
his laying-out and subsequent removal. There is a routine about
death as about birth. The immensity of the spiritual change is
obscured by the methodical functions of material life. Yet death
is the supreme adventure.</p>

<p>It seemed sad for the old man to have met this great adventure
among strangers, to go forth silently, without tears or prayers or
love from us who watched. Yet I think this quiet, unemotional
passing is dignified. Very soon afterwards the orderlies came with
a stretcher and the Union Jack for pall, and so the old man left us.
His body went to the mortuary, and his soul—surely, ‘his soul
goes marching on.’ And all the time the other men slept like weary
children. Only Harman sat up, still awake and watchful in his
terrible nervous tension.</p>

<p>Hospital is a world to itself, and those outside know little of
it; so one often thought, when visitors expressed surprise that we
all seemed cheerful. Of course we were not all cheerful or always
cheerful. The cheerfulness of the Tommy is a composite thing.
In part it is due to his youth and his character, and is in that sense<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432"></a>[432]</span>
natural; but it is in part his religion—in some cases his only real
religion. To be cheerful is ‘to play the game’—that wonderful,
indefinite, sacred ‘Game’ of the English, which demands the
utmost of body and soul. Just sometimes a man who had become
one’s friend would admit the bitterness of his heart, would say
that he was ‘fed-up,’ only to laugh it off and ask the eternal
riddle, ‘Where’s the good of grumbling?’ So we were really
cheerful at most times, but I always thought the most cheerful
time the hours between five o’clock and eight in the morning.</p>

<p>In a surgical ward dressings are begun between four and five
o’clock, but the general stir is not till five. It was customary in
many wards for Sisters and nurses to provide an early cup of tea
for the patients, and the Jocks and a few others had porridge. This
was the time of sing-songs. Torrey-Alexander hymns were sandwiched
between such cheerful ditties as ‘What’s the Matter with
Father?’ and ‘Hulloa! hulloa! Who’s your Lady Friend?’ Then
of course we had the inevitable ‘Little Grey Home,’ and as surely
‘Michigan’ and ‘When Irish Eyes are Smiling.’ Meantime the bed
patients were washing and beds were being made. The men who
could get up were the last to move. If the delay became insupportable,
their more active companions would tip them on to the
floor—I have seen the whole bedstead turned upside down. The
men themselves were great bed-makers, and one could nearly
always find someone to give a hand in quite professional style.</p>

<p>Yes, things were cheerful in the mornings, and informal too. If
work was done early the Sisters and nurses had time for a private
and hasty cup of coffee in one of the dug-outs, and there was time,
too, for talk with the men, and always we had a cheery visit from
the ‘night super,’ Sister L. As for the war—the very reason of
our present estate—it was the subject least discussed. Sometimes
one almost forgot that there was a war. Every private house
worries and thinks more of war than any hospital ward does—or it
seems so. There might be dark thoughts under all the trivial discussions,
the little jokes, the conventional badinage that we carried
on, but they did not appear.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock the day staff arrived and our night was over—always,
I was a little sorry. There is a vague but eternal feud
between ‘the day people and the night people.’ The night staff
is ‘the cat’ for the day staff. Whatever is missing—spoons, mugs,
dressings, instruments—the solution of the mystery is clear—‘it’s
those night people.’ The day orderlies lay on the souls of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433"></a>[433]</span>
night nurses dozens of spoons, forks, and knives. The day Sister
thinks the night Sister either too easy or too harsh with her patients.
It is just one of the inevitables of life.</p>

<p>I shall think often now of those whose watch is by night—not
with any pity, for it is a strange, quiet life, but a happy one.
I only knew it in a rather dead season, not in the busy time when
trains were coming in and patients arriving nightly. There the
night staff has small time for reflection. The hours pass in a whirl
of bed-baths, dressings, and settlement. But it was not my good
fortune to know such nights.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_ROMANCE_OF_THE_BARBER"><i>THE ROMANCE OF THE BARBER.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>‘We’re much too early, John. I said we should be. There’s not a
sign of a bass.’ I lifted the sail and peered across the shining water.</p>

<p>‘Nought’s lost by bein’ in time, sir,’ said the old boatman.
‘They’ll sport with the flood. And there be another boat over
there. Mr. Harris and his little boy.’</p>

<p>‘He never misses these early tides,’ I said. ‘I suppose they
just suit him. He can have his sport before he has to open his
shop. He’s pretty venturesome to come out here by himself. But
I suppose he knows the Bar as well as you sailor-men?’</p>

<p>‘He didn’t at one time, sir. He’d as soon have set himself
down on a hot stove as come out here.’ And old John’s deep-set blue
eyes twinkled. ‘What changed him? Well, it all had to do with
his courtship, and getting of his wife. There’s a bit o’ ebb to run,
and whilst I fixes they minnows I’ll tell ’ee about it. Just let me
get at that locker fust. Thank ’ee, sir. That’s it.</p>

<p>‘Well, except that the good Lord had ordained his place in
the world, and so he were bound to fill it, I dunno but what the most
curious thing weren’t Mr. Harris coming to Appledore village at
all, and living among us rough fisher-folk, for to all appearance he
were as much out o’ place as a limpet in a garden rockery. And
you’ll agree, sir, when you hears ’ow I fust became acquainted
with him.</p>

<p>‘’Twas some while ago now, sir, and I’d a-been away from home,
out foreign down along the coast o’ Cuba, and ’twas a wretched
night when I sets foot once more on Appledore quay. Dark, and
wet, and blowy. No one weren’t about, and the shops were all shut,
and the street lamps had blowed out. The light from the barber’s
shop at the far corner were the only cheerful thing in sight. When
I gets to it, what should I see but a little, youngish, clean-faced,
bald-headed man in his shirt-sleeves, and with a white apron on,
and big gold spectacles, crouching against the wall, trying to shelter
hisself from the wind and wet. He looks up in a queer, blinky way,
and I stops.</p>

<p>‘“Why,” I says, “what’s this? Where’s old Puggy?”</p>

<p>‘“Mr. Pugstiles is dead,” pipes the little man, “and I’ve bought
his business. And some young men have thrown me out o’ the
shop,” and he coughs behind his ’and very genteel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435"></a>[435]</span></p>

<p>‘I opens the door. There was a dozen half-growed young
chaps sprawling about the shop and roaring with laughing, and
playing the fool. I never had no use for they scamps what hangs
about the ferry and won’t go to sea, and I was going to put ’em
out when the little man stops me.</p>

<p>‘“No, thank you,” he says very polite, “I would rather manage
this alone.”</p>

<p>‘So, as he wouldn’t let me help ’im, I goes off home. And that,
sir, were the fust time as ever I see Mr. Harris. I’ve known him a
long time now, but I’ve never forgot my fust sight o’ him, crouching
under the window, with the rain and wind beating down upon
him.</p>

<p>‘He were small and weak, and his chest were bad. That was
why he come away from London. His voice were peepy like a
chicken calling the old hen. He didn’t drink, and he didn’t smoke,
and he didn’t swear, and to say truth there was so many things
against him, no one could say which was the wust. He were the
fair butt o’ the place; even the women and girls derided him.</p>

<p>‘I was always a wanderer, and soon I goes off again, to Antwerp,
and then away to Java. I were three good years older when next
I landed on Appledore quay. ’Twas much such a night as t’other,
cold and wet and blowy. But the light from the barber’s shop
was shining out on the wet stones, and Mr. Harris, who I do believe
I hadn’t thought on since I went away, comes into my mind again,
all of a sudden.</p>

<p>‘“He’m gone. The place looks quiet enough now,” says I to
myself. Then I shoves open the door.</p>

<p>‘’Tis a long, narrow room, with benches at the side. They
benches were full o’ men sitting quiet waiting their turn. At the far
end I see Mr. Harris shaving away like a good ’un, his bald head
and his gold specs shining in the lamplight. I were so astonished
I stood still without speaking. Then he says in the peepy little
voice I remembered so well,</p>

<p>‘“I will ask one of you gentlemen kindly to shut that door,
and keep it shut.”</p>

<p>‘And I’m blest if the most cantankerous chap in the place
didn’t get up quite quiet, and shut it without a word. And then
I went home.</p>

<p>‘Well, sir, I found Mr. Harris had got to be boss of the village.
’Twas the wonderfullest thing! He was the same little weak man
I had fust seen, a surprised-looking creature with his big gold glasses,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_436"></a>[436]</span>
and his pale face, and his mouth half open, but lor bless you! the
whole place bowed down to him. He were Secretary to the Regatta,
and Churchwarden, and sang in the choir, and sometimes read the
lessons, and when the Vicar put in they peal of bells, with the
thing by which you can play times on ’em, it was Mr. Harris who
played on ’em all his spare time, till some folks who lived near the
church, and didn’t care for music, wished they bells further.</p>

<p>‘I saw what he was for myself a few days after I got home.
Me and Tom Jenkyns was passing his shop one fine morning and
Mr. Harris, in his white apron and gold specs, was on the quay
peering about in the sun. Tom ain’t a beauty when he’s sober,
which he weren’t then by no means, so I gets in between ’em.
Mr. Harris looks up in his gentle way through his glasses.</p>

<p>‘“Dear me, Mr. Jenkyns,” he says, “I am sorry to see you with
such a dirty chin! It wouldn’t do for you to meet a young lady
with that chin! Oh, no. You’d better come inside,” and he ’as
Tom in the shop and in the chair, and shaves him, and has ’im
outside again, before Tom could think where to tell him to go to.
Now that was a wonderful thing. Don’t ’ee think so, sir?’</p>

<p>‘Indeed I do,’ I said, for I knew Mr. Jenkyns pretty well. ‘How
on earth did he manage him? How did he work it?’</p>

<p>‘You may well ask that, sir. But ’tis more easy asked than
told. How did he do such things? None can say. He never
lost his temper; he never raised his voice, he never laughed—not
out loud. And he looked at you in that queer, wondering way.
And then his manners, and his politeness! And he never give in
to nobody.</p>

<p>‘Time went on, and he prospered. He was clever at his job,
having the London tricks, and he went about attending on gentlemen’s
houses. His ’ealth come back, and he got smarter and
younger looking, and he wore a white collar and a white shirt every
day, even under his apron. How ’e could abear they collars I can’t
think. When my wife puts one on me I feels like a bird in a cage.
But there, I s’pose it is all use. His white linen used to shine, and
his eyes shine through his glasses. And he painted his ’ouse white,
and put boxes of flowers in the windows. He rigged up a big red
and white barber’s pole, and on Sundays he ’oisted the Jack on
it. He did well, and we was proud of him.</p>

<p>‘And then, well then, just as everything was going so well,
what do you think happened, sir?’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps I can guess,’ I said. ‘The ladies. They took a hand?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437"></a>[437]</span></p>

<p>‘They did, sir. They did. They’d looked on Mr. Harris all
along with scorn, and troubled noth’en about him. Then all of
a sudden it come to ’em how blind they’d been. And that here
were a nice young man, for he were only a little over thirty, with
collars and shirts and a business, and beautiful manners, and a
white house with flowers in boxes, and all agoing begging. From
that moment he hadn’t a single hour’s peace. They was all at
him, though the old ’uns was the wust. They sent him things to
eat, and tried to get him to convoy ’em back from church. Old
Widow Paul were took ill on his door-step and had to be carried
into the shop. Miss Belcher, she as married pore old Tom Cole
after he ’ad broke his leg, attacked him on his business side, and
sent him a parcel of combings to be made up. Me and a lot o’
chaps was there when they come, and all I can say is, if they was
all out of her ’ead, she must have ’ad a scalp like a tortoise-shell
cat.</p>

<p>‘But it was all o’ no use. Mr. Harris didn’t like any o’ them,
maid or widow, and he kept away from ’em. He was well guarded
too; always there were someone in his shop. And the old woman
who kep’ house for him, her ’usband being in an ’ome for uncurables,
helped to keep ’em off.</p>

<p>‘Well, sir, things jogged along quite comfortable like till a
queer thing happened. Me and Jenkyns was in his shop one brisk
morning, when Tom, who ’ad a drop o’ beer in him as usual, winks
at me and says:</p>

<p>‘“You did ought to see my sister-in-law, Mr. Harris,” says
he; “she’d be the very young lady for you!”</p>

<p>‘Mr. Harris was stropping a razor. He looks round in
his queer blinky way, but instead o’ putting Tom down he
says:</p>

<p>‘“And what might she be like, Mr. Jenkyns?”</p>

<p>‘“She’m the fust girl in these parts. She lives with her mother
to Lundy Island. She can cook, and she’m house-wise; what’s
more she’m a heaven-born laundress, and she’m big and dark
with red cheeks and blue eyes, and her name is Mirandy,” says
Tom all in a breath.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Harris listens with his ’ead on one side, and a funny look
comes over his face and his eyes sparkles. Tom forgets hisself
and spits on the floor, but instead o’ requesting him to leave the
shop Mr. Harris only says,</p>

<p>‘“And does the young lady ever come over here, Mr. Jenkyns?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438"></a>[438]</span></p>

<p>‘“She does not,” says Tom; “she bides to home and ’elps her
mother. Capt. Dark, who goes to Lundy every week with the
mails, have many a time offered her a free pass on his lugger, but
she wouldn’t accept.”</p>

<p>‘“But—but her affections?” says Mr. Harris presently very
gently; “perhaps they are engaged? Such a young lady!”</p>

<p>‘“She ain’t got no chap, if that’s what you mean,” says Tom;
“there ain’t none to Lundy. Last time I come away I thought
’twere a pity there weren’t no young feller to arm ’er up the rocks.
She were as pretty as a picture, with the waves breaking all about
her feet.”</p>

<p>‘“Sea King’s daughter,” says Mr. Harris to hisself. But I
heered ’im.</p>

<p>‘“She knows about you,” Tom goes on. “I tells her in general
conversation what a deal people think o’ you. ‘He must be a
leader o’ men,’ says she. But there is a phottygraf o’ her to
home. I’ll fetch ’un,” and with that he goes out and Mr. Harris
has me in the chair, and shaves me. His ’and were shaking so
I were glad to escape without bloodshed. Then Tom comes back,
and hands over the photty. Mr. Harris looks at it, and drops the
razor. He gets pinker and pinker, and smiles and laughs and sets
it on a little shelf and gazes upon it. As he doesn’t speak we
goes out quietly. Then I remembers I hasn’t paid for my shave.
So I goes back just in time to hear ’im say:</p>

<p>‘“An arrow—an arrow from the blind god’s bow at last!”</p>

<p>‘I says nothing, but puts down my penny and comes away on
tiptoe.</p>

<p>‘Well, sir, that puzzles me. And I asks my darter the school-mistress
what he meant. All I can say is, sir, if that little god as
she telled me of did shoot one o’ his arrows at Mr. Harris, he must
ha’ got him right in the wes’cot. For from that moment he were
a changed man.</p>

<p>‘He were properly in love and no mistake! He worn’t a bit
ashamed o’ it. He went about smiling and blushing, and very
proud. The news soon got abroad, and the girls, some jeered,
some laughed. Things moved along quickly. Letters passes
between ’em. He ’ad his picture took, smiling, in a long black
coat and a flower in his button-hole and a book in his ’and. He
sends over bottles o’ scent and sweet soaps and such truck from
his shop. Then, one beautiful morning in the beginning o’ October,
he dresses hisself very smart, with a white wes’cot and shiny boots<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439"></a>[439]</span>
and new straw hat, and embarks on Dark’s lugger to go to Lundy
to call on his young lady.</p>

<p>‘Now, living as he did on the quay, no one ’adn’t partic’ly
noticed that Mr. Harris never went on the watter. Still Dark were
surprised when he tells him he ’ad never yet crossed Appledore
Bar. There was no wind, and Dark drops down with the ebb to
the Bar, just about where we be now, and then all of a sudden
Mr. Harris begins to be sea-sick. Dark carries many passengers,
and ’tis a queer bit o’ watter ’twixt here and Lundy, but he says
he never see anyone so bad as Mr. Harris was that day. It fair
tore the inside out o’ him. He gets in such a state that Dark,
seeing the job would be a long ’un for want o’ wind, puts him in
his dinghy and lands him on the golf-links. Mr. Harris crawls
into one o’ they bunker things and there he lay, and I did ’ear
that the gentlemen played their golf right on top o’ him afore
he could move. In the evening he creeps back home and goes to
bed.’</p>

<p>‘Poor Mr. Harris!’ I broke in, ‘that was rough luck. How
did he take it?’</p>

<p>‘Well, he didn’t give in, sir. Twice more he tried, but he
never even got to the Bar. The second time they had to call the
doctor to him. The doctor says his heart were weak, and it were
very onwise to put such a strain on it, and he mustn’t try them
tricks again. Then the doctor puts a mustard plaster to him,
and goes away.</p>

<p>‘After that no one would take him. Steamers from ’Coombe
had stopped running or ’e might ha’ gone by them. He felt hisself
beaten, and his pride were broken. ’Twas a melancholly affair
altogether. He thought he ’ad made a fool o’ hisself, though
how a man can be stronger than his stomach I can’t see.</p>

<p>‘And the wust o’ all was to come. Mirandy thought she were
a laughing-stock, and wouldn’t help. She wouldn’t come to him.
If he wanted her, ’e must fetch her. She wouldn’t leave Lundy by
herself for any man, so she said. And everyone were laughing,
and talking, and taking sides.</p>

<p>‘He goes about neat and particular as usual, but the life and
sparkle had gone out o’ him. He were looked up to, and had ’is
business and his nice house, but he didn’t want ’em. He wanted
Mirandy by his fireside, and her ’and in his.</p>

<p>‘Late one evening I was on Look-out Hill, when I hears a footstep
and sees Mr. Harris. He stands staring out to sea, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_440"></a>[440]</span>
presently up pops Lundy Light and twinks and goes out, and pops
up and twinks and goes out again.</p>

<p>‘“When I sees that light,” says Mr. Harris at last, “I thinks
she is beckoning me”; and from the sound o’ his voice I guessed
he were near crying.</p>

<p>‘“It is not the fust time a queasy stomach have kept loving
hearts apart,” says I, wishing to comfort him.</p>

<p>‘“Love against stomach,” he says very bitter, and walks away
without saying good night.</p>

<p>‘The fine weather held well into October that year, sir; then
one night there come the wust blow known in these parts. It blew
hurricane hard from the nor’-west on a big spring flood. The watter
come right up the streets and flooded the houses. The whole place
were in an uproar. And to make things wuss, about midnight,
when the storm were at its height, the lifeboat rocket was fired.
A big ship were ashore on Lundy.’</p>

<p>‘I heard of that gale,’ I said; ‘a barge was put over the sea-wall
at Instow.’</p>

<p>‘That’s right, sir. Well, you knows the rule about the lifeboat,
fust come fust served. They that gets there fust goes. I grabs
my oilies and runs. Me and Tom Jenkyns get there amongst the
fust. Old Batten, the cox’un, gives us our cork jackets. ’Twas
pitchy dark. There was no lights but the hurricane lamps and
rope flares, and they kept blowing out. You couldn’t hear yourself
speak for the wind and watter. What was done were done dumb
show, and the boys and people all yelling and shouting.</p>

<p>‘We mans the boat. She was on her cradle and Batten were
just giving the word to let go, when who should come shoving and
pushing through the crowd but Mr. Harris. Tom and me was in
the bows, and he spies us and clasps his ’ands.</p>

<p>‘“Take me, take me,” he cries, and stretches up to us.</p>

<p>‘Someone gives him a hoist up, and I grabs him, and pulls him
in. I don’t think Cap’n Batten see’d him till it were too late, what
with the wind and watter and blowing about of the lights, and
general confusion. And at that very moment the boat goes down
the ways like a rocket, and if Mr. Harris ’ad been half a minute
later she’d ha’ been over him. And that would have been the end
o’ his troubles for good and all.</p>

<p>‘He crawls under our seat and lays down. He had got on
a little thin overcoat over his other clothes, but nothing to be no
good. I throws down a spare jersey, and Tom a oilskin. Then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441"></a>[441]</span>
I tosses him a bottle o’ tea and brandy as my missis always gives
me.</p>

<p>‘“You’ve done it this time!” I yells. “You must fend for
yourself now. I can’t help you.”</p>

<p>‘We drops down the river, for the tide was ebbing strong. And
then I realises what the weight o’ wind was. I’ve see’d some queer
seas in my time, but never a wuss bit o’ watter than the Bar here
was that night, smooth as oil though it be now. The great wind
met the great tide, and raised a hurricane sea; the boat herself
couldn’t ha’ faced it if the wind hadn’t just then hauled a couple
o’ points, and let us get a bit o’ sail on her. Even then I didn’t
know half the time whether I were right side or wrong side up.
Cold, wet, and rough work it were. But at last we gets over and
away and shapes a course for Lundy.</p>

<p>‘Before long the wind takes off a bit, and the sea begins to
moderate. ’Twas a queer blow altogether. Not a drop o’ rain to it,
and all the wind’ard side o’ the hedges were crisp and black as if
fire had burned ’em. Then the sky cleared and the day broke.
There were the barque ashore on the Hen and Chickens Rocks,
north end o’ the island. Two boats was standing by her, the
Braunton and ’Coombe boats; so we rows along to the landing-place,
which were sheltered, and brings up. And then me and
Tom bends down and fishes up Mr. Harris.</p>

<p>‘You recollect, sir, he ’ad been rolling about in the watter in
the bottom of the boat the better part o’ the night. I never see
such a melancholly sight! He ’ad no hat, one shoe were gone,
his shirt and wes’cot were half tored off. And the queasiness—!
But never mind that! His gold glasses were smashed, and he ’ad
a great bleeding cut over one eye from the bottle o’ tea and brandy,
which had broke. I judged him pretty near gone; he were cold
as a stone, and half drowned.</p>

<p>‘We turns to, and gives him a rub, and shoves a warm jersey
on him, and Cap’n Batten, without making no remark, shoves down
a bottle to us, o’ brandy. That pulls him round a bit. He looks
about him and points to the island. We nods, and he slips down
again.</p>

<p>‘Just then a boat puts off, and when she gets alongside I see
Mirandy was in her. She looks as pretty as a picture, with her
red cap and red cheeks, and blue eyes all of a sparkle. One o’
our chaps clears his throat and coughs, and then another till all the
boat were doing it. And even Cap’n Batten, though he were high<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442"></a>[442]</span>
up in the Wesleyans, and ’ad ninety-eight grandchildren, winks
at her.</p>

<p>‘Then she says, looking up very demure, and trying not to
laugh:</p>

<p>‘“If you please, Cap’n Batten, is my brother-in-law Tom
Jenkyns in the boat? And if he is may he come ashore? Mother
wants to see him.”</p>

<p>‘“He be aboard, my dear,” says Cap’n Batten, “but I can’t let
no one leave the boat. We been out all night, and we’m for home
now. But you can give ’un a message. He’m down there forrard.”</p>

<p>‘The boat comes down and she gives the message, and then
Tom says,</p>

<p>‘“We got something nice for you, Miry.”</p>

<p>‘“For me?” says Mirandy, shaking her curls. “What can that
be?”</p>

<p>‘“We’ve brought your young man. He’m come to fetch you
after all,” says Tom.</p>

<p>‘We pokes up Mr. Harris from the bottom of the boat, and
then, sir, they two has their fust look at one another.’</p>

<p>‘By Jove, John!’ I said, ‘that must have been a moment!
What happened?’</p>

<p>‘I never see’d anybody’s face, man or woman, change like
Miry’s did, sir. What she had expected him to be like I don’t
know; but not what he was like then, I be sure. And fust one o’
us laughs, and then another, till the boat’s crew were busting their
sides. Mr. Harris draws hisself together, and looks at us in that
blinky, half-puzzled way, and fust one chap looks shamed and
stops, and then another, till there was silence. Then he looks down
again at Mirandy, and she laughs and gets red, and a funny look,
pitiful like, comes into her face, and she gets scarlet red, and stretches
out her arms. We lifts him down, and she helps ’im into her boat,
and she wipes the blood from his face, and he puts his arm round her,
for I reckon he’d ’ad about enough o’ it. Then the boy rows them
ashore, and we watches her ’elping him up the rocks, till we loses
sight o’ them. And then, sir, we sets sail for home.</p>

<p>‘And that be the way, sir, that Mr. Harris come to Lundy
Island for his wife. And I reckon he deserved her! Don’t you
think so, sir?’</p>

<p>‘He did,’ I said warmly, ‘if ever a man did. Many a man has
dared a lot for the sake of a girl, but I think Mr. Harris has earned
a place among the bravest of them. He might well have died that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_443"></a>[443]</span>
night, and he must have known the lifeboat wouldn’t put back for
him.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir. He did, o’ course. It were kill or cure, and he knowed
it. I reckon he felt ’twere the only way to get there, so there it
was! But ’twas all right. He stayed to Lundy, and Parson Heaven,
who owned the island then, married them. And that’s the way
Mr. Harris got his bride, sir.’</p>

<p>‘But hold on,’ I said; ‘that’s not all the yarn. How did he
get back again?’</p>

<p>‘I’ll tell you how he brought her ’ome, sir, if you pleases. The
tide and the yarn will about finish together.</p>

<p>‘Well, the fame o’ Mr. Harris soon spread abroad, and all were
anxious to welcome him ’ome. The women forgave him, and
spoke well o’ him, and were pleased he ’ad got Miry for his wife at
last. The day Dark went over, chartered special, to fetch the happy
pair home, Appledore were fair a-buzz. Dark, he puts a new suit
o’ sails on the lugger, and when he gets to Lundy and ships
Mr. and Mrs. Harris he rigs up every bit o’ bunting he can lay
hands on. And home he comes booming with a nice soft breeze.
Seventeen o’ our ketches and two small barques was on the Bar
that evening, waiting for the tide, and when they see the lugger
coming, all dressed and glorious, they cheers, and gives her the
road, and falls in behind. Then the lugger reaches the sand-barges,
and they cheers and falls in behind too. And further up the river
she finds the town band on a barge, and the little rowing and sailing
boats all come out to shout and welcome the bride and bridegroom
home.</p>

<p>‘So up they comes. Up the river with a swingeing flood tide,
and a fair breeze and a bright sky, and all shining and sparkling.
The old walls and slips and yards was crowded, and everyone
cheered and waved. The Vicar he started the bells, and hoists the
flag on the church tower. ’Twas a grand and wonderful sight.</p>

<p>‘Fust comes the lugger, with Dark and his mate keeping well
out o’ sight, and Mr. and Mrs. Harris standing well forrard so that
all might see. And as they come Mr. Harris takes off his tall
hat and bows and waves, this way and that way, while his bald
head and new glasses shines in the sun. And Mrs. Harris, who
’ad got her wedding clothes sent over from ’Coombe, furls her
white parasol, and bows that way and this way, very dignified,
from the hips like. Then comes the band a-banging away, and
then the little row-boats and sailing boats, and then the barges<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444"></a>[444]</span>
and ketches and trawlers, and two barques, and all shouting and
cheering. And what was best o’ all, sir,’ said old John, tapping my
knee in his earnestness, ‘there were no nasty steamers with their
smeech and noise. ’Twas all good sails, sweet and pleasant.</p>

<p>‘Well, Dark brings to, and drops anchor off the quay. Cap’n
Batten goes off with his gig, me bein’ one o’ the crew. We brings
Mr. and Mrs. Harris ashore, and they lands on the quay. The mob
form a lane, and Mr. Harris leads his wife along it. Outside his
’ouse he stops, and waves his ’at again, and bows and smiles, and
then puts his arm round Mrs. Harris and kisses her afore everyone.
Then he opens the door, and takes her in, and shuts it.</p>

<p>‘And that, sir, is how Mr. Harris brought his wife to Appledore.’</p>

<p>The old man paused and sighed. ‘It were a brave sight,’ he
said. ‘Mr. Harris is up for the Council now. He says ’twill be
the proudest day o’ his life if he gets put in. H’m wrong there. His
proudest day were when he brought his wife home to Appledore.’</p>

<p>‘But what about the queasiness coming home?’ I demanded,
‘and why didn’t⸺’ but my questions were only partially asked.
A shiver came over the shining water; a myriad trickles and rivulets
spread themselves over the great mass of sand that lay exposed
to our right hand. The tide had turned.</p>

<p>‘Get your rod, sir; they won’t be long now. Watch the gulls!
The queasiness? Oh, that never come back. The doing in the lifeboat
were kill or cure, and it cured him. Anyway, he never ’ad no
more o’ it. He—but look there, sir! There’s the bass. My yarn’s
spun just in time.’</p>

<p>I flicked the blue-and-white minnow free of the rod. Old John
knocked the ashes out of his pipe, and grasped the oars. For the
rest of the morning <i>Perca Labrax</i> held the stage.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SIGNS_AND_NOTICES_ON_THE_WESTERN_FRONT"><i>SIGNS AND NOTICES ON THE WESTERN FRONT.</i></h2>

<p class="author">BY F. J. SALMON.</p>

</div>

<p>From the military landing officer’s placard, telling you where to
report and what to do, which faces you on the quay before landing
in France, to the stencilled board informing you that the recently
captured portion of German trench you are standing in was called
‘Stellung 19,’ the ‘Front’ is plastered with notices and signs of
every description.</p>

<p>Some are bald official orders of little interest, others are full
of meaning and sometimes bring the grim realities of war home
to one more than any other feature of the landscape, and yet others—the
unofficial ones—are full of humour and eloquent of the cheerful
spirit which comes uppermost in the British soldier, be his
surroundings ever so miserable.</p>

<p>The most conspicuous ones are those that are intended to be
seen by the swiftly passing motor-car—<span class="smcap">Speed Limit X Miles Per
Hour</span>,—<span class="smcap">Go Slow Past The Column</span>,—<span class="smcap">Aerodrome, Dead Slow
To Avoid Dust Spoiling The Engines</span>.</p>

<p>It is regrettable that sufficient notice is not always taken of
such injunctions and those who are affected often have recourse
to other tactics. Some are frankly threatening: <span class="smcap">Drivers’
Numbers Taken And Reported To The A.P.M.</span> Others appeal
to our better feelings—the notice is put in the form of a request,
and a large <span class="smcap">Thank You</span> at the end of the restricted stretch shames
the scorcher who has kept his foot on the throttle. Others again
resort to subterfuges, such as <span class="smcap">Mind The Bump!</span> There is, of course,
no bump, but by the time the driver has found this out and got
up his speed again the column of lorries, or whatever it may have
been by the roadside, is passed.</p>

<p>In addition to the military road restrictions there are still, of
course, the curious mystic signs of the French Auto Club—the grid
showing the level crossing gate, the cross for the cross roads and
the V or Z for single or double corners.</p>

<p>In order not to make things too easy for the Hun agent most
units do not label their billets or transport with their full title, but
adopt certain devices and signs which are allotted to them. These
assume the form of flowers, animals, or geometric designs of every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_446"></a>[446]</span>
conceivable pattern and colour. They are to be seen everywhere—few
people know what they mean and the spy who would sort out
the signs and the units they represent has an unenviable job.</p>

<p>In some cases, however, where secrecy does not appear to be
necessary, appropriate emblems are used. I remember one day
my car broke down opposite a column of lorries belonging to an
Australian unit. On the side and back of each of these vehicles
was painted a white kangaroo.</p>

<p>My Scottish Sergeant-Major, though a fervent admirer of the
gallant colonials, could not resist a gentle leg-pull. With an air
of ignorant innocence he went up to a group of men and asked them
what on earth they painted pictures of mice all over their lorries
for! He affected to be immensely interested in their explanation.</p>

<p>As one approaches the front there are signs and directions
innumerable—the arrows and flags showing the way to casualty
clearing stations, signposts of all kinds showing the way to dumps,
divisional baths, watering places for horses, canteens, headquarters,
field cashiers, the local cinema show, or the Y.M.C.A. hut.</p>

<p>It is in the villages where the troops nearest the line are billeted
that the greatest variety of amusing inscriptions is to be found.
At a badly strafed cross roads in a certain village there is a small
round shell hole, not unlike a booking office, in the wall of a house.
Above it are the words: <span class="smcap">Blighty Corner—Book Here!</span> It
was in the same village that the Xth Siege Battery had the whole
side of their mess knocked out—you could drive a gun team through
the hole where the door had been. On a bit of remaining wall
are the words: <span class="smcap">Don’t Stand Out There Knocking—Come Right
In!</span></p>

<p>The streets are often labelled with names which at once give
evidence as to the present or late occupants of the billets in them—Piccadilly,
Prince’s Street, Black Watch Street, Quebec Street,
Springbok Laager.</p>

<p>The French names have, however, often been retained, and
everywhere, for the benefit of the civilian population, one sees the
warning—<span class="smcap">Taisez Vous, Méfiez Vous—Les Oreilles Ennemies
Vous Écoutent</span>. In more than one French office this notice is
decorated with amusing pictures of Huns with huge ears listening
from round corners.</p>

<p>In one place it has been possible to devise a bi-lingual notice—</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2"><span class="smcap">Danger</span> pay <span class="smcap">Attention</span></td>
    <td>to the</td>
    <td rowspan="2"><span class="smcap">Trains</span>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>aux</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_447"></a>[447]</span></p>

<p>A ‘poilu,’ who had come back to his village near the firing line
on ‘permission’ and who wished to indulge in a little quiet gardening
in the diminutive plot behind his cottage, was confronted with
a large notice—<span class="smcap">Danger—Blind Shell</span>. His wife had to explain
to him that a German 8-inch ‘dud’ had buried itself there. Being
one whose duties lie on the lines of communication, he had not
acquired that contempt for the unexploded shell which the ‘Bairnsfather’
Tommy has and so the garden was left severely alone!</p>

<p>The position of this good French soldier is worthy of remark.
He was a farrier at some way back supply depot and, in his whole
life, had not heard a shot fired in anger. It was only when he
came home on leave that he experienced the thrills of being under
shell fire, and it was from his women folk that he had to learn the
precise moment when he could decently retire to the cellar without
an undue display of timidity! Ye Gods! What a leave! We
may well be thankful if we get nothing more alarming than a
Zeppelin raid when doing our week in town!</p>

<p>The French villagers who sell groceries, eggs, wine, or ‘Anglish
Beere’ in the many half-ruined shops in the shelled area advertise
their goods often with notices in the weirdest of Anglo-French
spelling, and it is extraordinary in what surroundings some of them
manage to carry on business.</p>

<p>I know of one little ‘épicerie’ which does a roaring trade in a
house that has no roof and practically only three walls. The place
has been made more or less weatherproof with some pieces of tin
and a few planks. The rest of the village has been smashed to
pieces. The neighbourhood is shelled almost daily, and whenever
I pass I look, not without anxiety, to see if the plucky old lady’s
sign is still there.</p>

<p>At the ruined railway station of a certain town near the line
the notice—‘<span class="smcap">Billets</span>’—still stands over the shattered booking
office, and, sure enough, if you hunt around among the débris you
will find tickets to Charing Cross! At another station a few miles
away and also within sight of the German trenches the door labelled—‘<span class="smcap">Sortie</span>’—is
barred with wreckage and is about the only part
of the building you can <i>not</i> walk in and out of at will!</p>

<p>Not very far away some of my own unit were once billeted in
part of what was once a French Barracks, and it was here that I
was shown some inscriptions of quite historical interest.</p>

<p>On the ground floor the walls bear the initials and names of
‘regular,’ ‘terrier,’ and K.’s army, together with those of many a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_448"></a>[448]</span>
French poilu. The top storey has been smashed in by a 15-centimetre
shell, but the stonework round the windows remains, and
there, cut in the limestone, are to be found records of British
soldiers who had tenanted those rooms under very different circumstances!
<span class="smcap">J. Jemison, Prisoner of War—Taken August
1806—Alderson—Ellis—Wheatley</span> P. of W. 1806, 07, 08, 09,
10. Rather a long spell! but, knowing our French friends as we
do now, we can be sure their imprisonment was not wholly unpleasant.</p>

<p>Some of the most incongruous of signs are the ordinary hand-posts
at cross roads indicating the way to places over ‘the other
side.’ I seldom pass one of these plain iron signs without thinking
of the strange contrast between the life now and that of three years
ago. An arrow points towards a straight white road leading over
the hill—<span class="smcap">Bapaume X Kilomètres</span>. Not so very far either and
yet no man on earth could get there!—though a whole army can,
and will in time. Over the crest the smooth surface is cut by
innumerable trenches and barred with wire entanglements. Even
here, at the cross roads, though well out of view, it is unwise to
linger—the Huns have a machine-gun trained down the road and
open indirect fire at intervals.</p>

<p>On first coming to the front it is curious to see an immortal
name like Neuve Chapelle displayed on an ordinary everyday signpost—what
would an American souvenir hunter give for such a
relic!</p>

<p>When travelling towards the line, as you begin to get near things
the type of traffic notice alters. Motorists are no longer asked to
‘mind the bump’ nor horsemen to ‘keep off the crops.’ <span class="smcap">Road
Closed to all but Single Vehicles or Infantry in Small
Parties</span> shows that it is unwise to attract the attention of the
German observation balloon opposite. Then you may come to a
sentry with a red flag who stops you and points to a large placard—VEHICLES
4 MILES AN HOUR. <span class="u"><span class="smcap">Dust must not be Raised.</span></span>
The Hun has probably got a gun or two laid on this bit of road
and his observer is watching patiently for a tell-tale wisp of dust!
After this it will probably not be very long before you have to get
out and walk. <span class="smcap">Road under Enemy Observation—No Traffic
of any Kind Beyond this Point During Daylight Hours.</span></p>

<p>There will be another sentry here and he will show you the way
to the communication trench unless your work is of some special
nature and you have a pass that entitles you to walk on and risk it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_449"></a>[449]</span></p>

<p>As soon as the trench zone is reached notices and signboards
are more frequent than ever. In addition to our own direction
posts and trench names there are also, frequently, relics of the
French occupation. <span class="smcap">Vers le Front</span>, <span class="smcap">Vers l’Arrière</span>, or the
names of communication and fire trenches, such as <span class="smcap">Boyau Rideau</span>,
<span class="smcap">Tranchée Illot</span>.</p>

<p>Again as we approach the firing line the remarks of the wag
and the humorist are more frequent. In one place there is a board
with a finger pointing to a peculiarly unhealthy sap and inscribed—<span class="smcap">To
The War!</span> A frequently shelled trench junction bears the
legend—<span class="smcap">Don’t Stand About Here—There’s A War On!</span></p>

<p>The signpost <span class="smcap">To Berlin</span> is of course common—or was.</p>

<p>Many of the dug-outs bear fantastic names and, in addition
to notices giving the designation of those who occupy them, often
have other inscriptions, hospitable or otherwise, such as <span class="smcap">Dew Drop
Inn</span> or <span class="smcap">No Room Here</span>. Those with a double entrance sometimes
display the most fearful threats to those who would attempt to go
in by the ‘out’ passage, whereas some such remark as <span class="smcap">The Only
Way</span> is inscribed over the correct entrance.</p>

<p>It must be remarked, however, that any apparent inhospitality
is usually in the interests of the service—the nearer one gets to
the front line the more hospitable are the Messes.</p>

<p>The mural decorations of the dug-outs are also worthy of more
than superficial notice, as they often reflect the interests or character
of the occupants. The pretty faces of ‘Harrison Fisher,’ ‘Philip
Boileau,’ and other girls smile at one from the walls of many of these
abodes, and Bairnsfather pictures caricaturing the very scenes of
the life going on outside are to be seen everywhere. Grim pictures
of the war from the pen of Matania and other artists may be found
in the dug-outs of some of the more serious-minded, while others
show their hankering after yachting, shooting, or racing. A total
of many thousands of square feet of wall space must be taken up
by cuttings from the ‘Vie Parisienne,’ and in many cases, more
especially in the French lines, the occupant himself has been
responsible for the pictures and designs in his quarters.</p>

<p>The enemy, too, has his notice boards, and some of them are
written and stuck up on the parapet for our benefit or otherwise.
Insulting remarks are not infrequently displayed in this way.
Sometimes he brags about some big gun he is bringing up to shell
our back billets with, sometimes we are told that he is quite ready
for our attack on such and such a date—information which is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_450"></a>[450]</span>
usually incorrect. The German notice with which continental
travellers were, perhaps, most familiar before the war is conspicuous
by its absence—<span class="smcap">Nicht Hinauslehnen</span>; it would, however, be a
most appropriate warning for visitors to the trenches!</p>

<p>On captured ground some of the German notices and signs still
remain, but many have been replaced. A spot which had once
been used by the Germans as a dump for stores is now labelled—<span class="smcap">Fritz’s
Dump—Under Entirely New Management!</span></p>

<p>Those who have their being in the observation posts are particularly
shy of visitors and—<span class="smcap">No Admittance</span>—placards of all
descriptions greet one at their entrances. In this the observers
show their wisdom, for the inexperienced may unwittingly give
away the position to the enemy.</p>

<p>It is not always necessary to show oneself to do this. A few
puffs of smoke from a pipe, or the use of a telescope without a
protecting cowl to keep the sun from reflecting in it, may bring
about destruction. I remember a careless Hun drawing attention
to an otherwise well concealed post by flourishing an unshaded
telescope in the sunlight!</p>

<p>A comic relief to a scene of havoc and destruction in an observation
post was once presented to me by a portion of a printed notice
giving instructions as to what observers were to look out for and
report. The post had been spotted, and after the expenditure of
many rounds, the enemy had at last obtained a direct hit. Crawling
in through the débris to report the damage, I was confronted by a
broken beam to which item 2 of the notice was still adhering—<span class="smcap">What
Are The German Guns Firing At?</span> Would that the answer
had been less easy to guess!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IN_SALONICA_KING_CONSTANTINES_FETE"><i>IN SALONICA: KING CONSTANTINE’S FÊTE.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>The last day but one! It was my first waking thought. The hot
June sun, streaming in from the windows facing the beech-crowned
summit of Mount Kotos, which rose above the bare lower downs,
warned me it was time to be gone. The wise storks and swallows
had already started on their long summer flight; it was time to
be following the birds North, as the <i>Thraki</i> was to sail next day.</p>

<p>It was a fascinating place I was leaving, this city on the outer
wave of the whirlpool. Salonica had proved unexpectedly interesting,
with its little known treasures of art and archæology, and its
strange old medley of East and West now further complicated by
a new Frankish crusade.</p>

<p>Here were the same mixed feelings of admiration and contempt
as at Byzantium, when the kings and knights of Western Chivalry
camped for the first time without the walls. Here, too, surprised
and equally unwilling hosts watched the foreign soldiery ride
clattering through their streets. Here were the same alarums and
excursions, the same continual vague, political intrigues, and at
the back of it all the same real indifference as to whether French,
German, or Russian finally won the Holy Shrine,—or what would
seem more likely now, Franco-Spanish Jews.</p>

<p>Each day brought some novel turn of the wheel of Greco-German
affairs or some fresh discovery in my exploration of the
old Byzantine city on the hill. The summer sun, which woke me
up betimes, left me lazily counting one by one, through the mist
of my mosquito net, the tall white minarets of the town. Delicate,
slender shafts holding the Muezzin’s gallery high in the air, they
rose on terrace above terrace to the last broken spire, near where
the brown brick towers of the Heptapyrgeion stood out clear-cut
against the sky.</p>

<p>These minarets, with their finely-contrasting cypress trees, are
numerous at Salonica, for the Turks invariably added one when
they altered a church into a mosque. The Greek king did well
to leave them standing when he took back the town from the
Moslems. Apart from their picturesque beauty, the minarets
still serve a useful purpose; for guide books leave one in Old
Greece, they are not to be had at Salonica. Should your way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_452"></a>[452]</span>
lie down the tram-ridden Boulevard Reine Olga, where the roses in
the villa gardens are powdered thick with dust, the public will
direct you proudly. Or they will cheerfully point out the Rue
Venizelos, and even follow you up the dim Turkish Bazaar at its end,
urging you to buy from their various eager friends as you pass.
Beyond that, across the Roman Via Egnatia, which cuts the town
in half, nobody seems to know what happens, nor should a well-brought-up
Salonican wish to go.</p>

<p>But the minarets beckon; they prove the best of guides.
Their white spires give a sure clue to the whereabouts of the
ancient mosques and churches. And here, through my window,
I could count most of these landmarks by which I steered. Nearest
and tallest rose the minaret of Sancta Sophia, Holy Wisdom, the
cathedral church of the Metropolitan.</p>

<p>During the ceremonies of Holy Week and Easter great crowds had
gathered here. Good Friday was the day of the people’s procession.
The peasants from the scattered villages brightened the town with
the cheerful reds and blues of their national costumes, and at
night all the world walked singing solemn chants, following the
bishops in their glittering copes and jewelled mitres and the simple
flower-arched bier.</p>

<p>Easter Eve proved to be the official festival of the Greek army
and government. A dense mass of people filled the church and
surged confusedly in the darkness of the open square outside it;
each man, woman, and child, holding an unlit candle in their
hands—some large, some small—painted with holy symbols and
flowers; careful souls, mindful of their gala clothes, taking pains
to hold their candle gingerly by its long cotton wick.</p>

<p>Within the building the deep gloom was hardly broken by the
lights at the two lecterns, at which the laity read by turns, and the
glimmer from where behind the icon-screen came the murmur of
priests intoning. After what felt an interminable period of waiting,
it was midnight. ‘Christ is risen,’ came the cry. The heavy
gold embroidered curtain rose, disclosing within the sanctuary
the long, low Altar of the Last Supper. Out poured a brilliant
procession of ecclesiastics, marching down the nave to take their
stand on the platform in the outer court; everyone in the crowd
lighting his candle from his neighbour’s as the <i>cortège</i> passed along.
In a moment the church was bright from end to end. The massive
pillars stood like rocks in a waving flickering sea of gold. Then,
for the first time, the great Madonna of the apse shone revealed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_453"></a>[453]</span>
Enthroned on high, against the hollow, glowing background of
mosaic, She held out Her Son to bless a strange assemblage under
the dome, where British and French officers stood with their Greek
comrades, headed by the Greek General Commanding, and all his
staff, each holding a lighted taper in honour of His resurrection.</p>

<p>What a night for the German aircraft, suddenly flashed across
our minds! In the very street outside, now lit with a thousand
lights and packed with human beings, I had seen their ugly work
only a few weeks before. I shuddered as we forged our way home.</p>

<p>Up the hill directly above Sancta Sophia, the somewhat stumpy
minaret of St. Paraskevi reared its head. This grand fourth-century
basilica, finer than any building of its kind at Constantinople,
is now given over to the Greek refugees from Asia Minor. Their
carpets and piteous coloured rags hang in complete disorder from
its high wooden galleries.</p>

<p>The platform for the Mihrab, facing towards Mecca, remains
aslant the apse; although a tiny altar at its northern end claims
the church back for its Christian builders—an altar so small and
poor, adorned by such dim, feeble lights, I hardly noticed it at first
the day I found my way in there. Here were no crowds, no pomp
of a church militant, only the begging children who trotted in my
wake. The place appeared empty except for a solitary peasant
woman, bowed in prayer before the icon on the little shrine, praying,
no doubt, for a safe return to her distant home in Syria—her dress
proclaimed how far the wars had driven her. She stood there, a
strange impassive figure in her full dark purple trousers and dull red
veil, silhouetted sharply against the cream plaster walls and the
cipollino columns brown with age and dirt. A faint blue smoke
curled from under the unseen cooking-pots in the gallery behind her,
blurring the light from the large windows and drifting out across
the wide open space. Through it, the arches of the nave and triforium
gleamed with the rose and gold and green of their splendid
floral mosaics.</p>

<p>Two more great churches the minarets pointed out. St. Demetrius,
dedicated to the City’s patron saint, is a basilica not unlike
that of the refugees. The mosaics here have a curious silvery
sheen, but the marbles are the church’s special glory. By some
piece of good fortune the original Byzantine casing of the walls
is almost intact. Remembering how this much coveted city has
suffered, how, time after time, it has been besieged, burnt, sacked—for
it stands where two famous highways cross, from Rome to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_454"></a>[454]</span>
Byzantium, from Vienna to the Aegean and the East—it is little
short of marvellous that any fine old buildings are left; still more so
that these treasures should have escaped the general doom of such
things. A wonderful mellow tone pervades the great interior, where
the one spot of brilliant colour is the gold flag of the Double Empire,
which holds the eagles of the East and West aloft.</p>

<p>Alas, that modern Greece should have St. Demetrius in its
clutches! The Turks at least left the marbles much as they found
them. The Greeks have written their recent triumph in huge
black letters right across the apse; October 1912—there is no
escaping that or the monstrous Austrian stove—another claimant
for the double eagles, which stretches its ugly arms over the
nave.</p>

<p>St. Demetrius, as is only right, was used to shelter soldiers
rather than refugee civilians. Sketching there I often wondered
why so many Greeks in khaki wandered in and out. Very devout
people, I thought, though their casual lounge and bored air rather
belied them. Anyway, I decided, they cannot all be former
sacristans on leave. To Frenchmen of every rank I soon grew
accustomed; the blue field uniform was invariably to be seen
admiring, drawing, or measuring, each time I went there. Even a
British officer strayed in at times, some odd, adventurous spirit
who cared for such things—unlike his kind. But why all these shabby
Greek Tommies?</p>

<p>One afternoon in the gathering dusk when it grew too dark to
work and I was exploring the empty upper galleries, to my astonishment
I nearly fell over a sick man. Startled and peering down
I saw it was a soldier curled up on his blanket bed. A comrade
was hastening to him bringing a pannikin full of water, his footsteps
echoing down the long gallery behind me. I beat a hurried retreat,
noticing as I did so the kit and beds of a whole company, neatly
rolled up for the day, lying in the shadow of the low marble railing.
But this was in May; since then there are fewer Royalist troops
tucked away in the heart of Salonica.</p>

<p>The furthermost great church—my favourite among all those
the minarets showed me—was the round fortresslike St. George,
built in the third century. It stands near the Arch of Galerius—the
Roman arch of triumph now resounding to the clang of the
British army motor-lorries. From its massive strength and air
of grave simplicity, it might be one of the towers guarding the eastern
wall of the town. No columns interrupt the view within, and on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_455"></a>[455]</span>
majestic dome, whose sweep leaves everything clear, is the greatest
monument in mosaic handed down from antiquity. It represents
a succession of saints, none later than the time of the Emperor
Constantine, who gaze pityingly down from the bronze and gold
Portals of the Heavenly City. The tall figures are just stiffening
from the grace and truth of the classic masters into the cramped
outlines of the monkish artists, who feared to study the human form
lest their models turned to wicked, tempting demons, all claws and
teeth and tail, under their very eyes. The Turks were even more
prejudiced on the subject, and defaced figures wherever met, no
matter how many robes they wore. But the charm of the whole is
quite unspoilt; it lies in the background.</p>

<p>The designer’s naïf joy in a fresh architectural expression shines
from this Byzantine Paradise of Revelations. It radiates from these
walls whose foundations were Jasper, Sardonyx, and Emerald—Chalcedony
from the Macedonian peninsula our troops now hold—and
all the other stones whose names are songs, from these arches
springing one above another, these shell-ribbed cupolas and alcoves,
these vistas of limitless arcades, where storks stand sentinel and
peacocks spread their jewelled tails, coloured like cornflowers in
grass.</p>

<p>On the low vaulting of the surrounding chapels, hollowed out
in the twenty foot thick fortress wall, humble local birds find a place.
Ducks and quails, cranes and smaller wild fowl from the Vardar
marshes cover the diapered gold ground. Under the Osmanli rule
these chapels were reserved for the different companies of the Sultan’s
Regiment of Guards, hence the church’s Moslem name—Orta Sultan
Osman Djami.</p>

<p>Last to be discovered at Salonica are the few Byzantine churches
so small and insignificant they were never claimed by the Turks.
No minarets point these out. But they are well worth finding for
their splendid carved and painted screens.</p>

<p>Backwards and forwards the churches’ fate has swung. Bullet
holes pit their soaring spires, witness to the most recent changes.
Feast days and Holy days abound in this town of many faiths.
Perhaps the prettiest among them is the Feast of Bairam, when the
minarets that remain in the hands of the Moslems twinkle with rows
of little lights. Then from my window I could see just how many
mosques were left; each one marked by a tall fairy candle, burning
steadily on the blue darkness of the hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_456"></a>[456]</span></p>

<p class="tb">‘Signora, wake, make haste, your Excellency’s boat leaves
to-day at noon!’</p>

<p>My reverie over the old town came to an abrupt stop. If this
were true, it was useless trying to decide where among all my
favourite haunts I would sketch for the last time.</p>

<p>Eudocia, the good-natured Greek-Italian maid, making a
noisy entry with my coffee, brought the surprising, unwelcome
news.</p>

<p>‘But the <i>Thraki</i> doesn’t sail until Saturday!’ I protested.
‘Are you sure?’</p>

<p>Yes, she was positive. Had not Anastasie, the porter, told
her this moment, having got it casually from the haughty-looking
Greek Staff Colonel as he flicked imaginary dust off his boots after
his early morning ride?</p>

<p>Well, I could not see V. again, or even let him know I was
going; that much was certain. But there was only one thing
to be done, and with a sinking heart I started to finish packing
as rapidly as I could. In the middle of it I remembered I must
rush off to the bankers who acted as my Salonican ‘Cook’; the
day before, when I had tried to see them, having been one of the
numerous fête days, when banks and shops were shut.</p>

<p>In the end there was too much to be done: I had to give up
the chase. The <i>Thraki</i> beat me, though not before I had boarded
her—luggageless. One peep into the tiny den I was to have slept
in made me thankful enough to see her start. The <i>Syria</i>, ‘<i>le
bateau de luxe</i>’ her agents proudly called her (that is the one Greek
ship whose decks were ever known to be washed), was to sail on
Monday; I should see V. again to say good-bye. All appeared
to be for the best.</p>

<p>He rode in that evening nothing doubting, bringing me wild
Madonna lilies, with sharp-pointed petals, from the hills above
Kerech-Koi; how sad to have missed them and him.</p>

<p>The next day, the day my ship was to have sailed, the town
was again <i>en fête</i>. It was more than a question of shutting the
banks and shops; this time the whole place was gay with pale
blue and white bunting for the festival of King Constantine, Bulgaroctonos
(Slayer of Bulgars)—an old title of the Greek Emperors
somewhat too hastily revived. St. Sophia was to be the scene of
another official service, one of triumph at past victories over the
King’s present friends.</p>

<p>Rather a tactless subject for so much rejoicing, I could not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_457"></a>[457]</span>
help thinking, as I heard the Greeks of the hotel going gaily out.
But, then, in the Balkans people’s politics change rapidly and
irony falls flat.</p>

<p>That day things were to move even faster than usual. The
service, if it was held, must have been short. It seemed only a
moment before the officials were back. It was a very crestfallen
little party I met on my way downstairs. The swords of the
Staff Colonel and his smart friends clanked dolefully up the marble
steps. The civilians, in their ceremonial evening dress and top
hats, looked as if they had been to a ball the night before which
had rather disagreed with them. I missed the Railway Controller,
a delicate little man with birdlike eyes and walk and a monstrous
moustache, who had so far successfully dodged all our demands
to open the new line connecting Salonica with Athens. But his
<i>confrère</i>, the Censor, was there, quite shorn of his heavy importance.
Even the cheerful fat Banker, who made it his business to keep
the pro-German party in roars of laughter every meal-time—presumably
over the Allies’ gullibility—for once hadn’t a smile left
and seemed completely nonplussed.</p>

<p>A shot rang out. Or was it only an extra loud bang on the
tramway outside? There was evidently some fresh trouble—perhaps
a daylight Zeppelin raid. Just then a French friend passed.</p>

<p>‘Haven’t you heard?’ she said, excitedly. ‘We have taken
the post-office and the telegraph; not without some fighting.
It was early this morning. Come out with me and see what arrives.’</p>

<p>King Constantine’s fête seemed to be off.</p>

<p>The life of the seaport was going on much as usual, except
that the quay in front had rather an empty look. But as we
turned up a side street, to avoid the press of the Rue Venizelos,
we ran into a big crowd. What it was all about was difficult to
discover, but it surged round a bewildered-looking Serbian soldier
who was being dragged away with some difficulty by a patrol of
Greek police. We flattened ourselves against the wall while the
angry waves swept past.</p>

<p>In their back-wash we came on the Official Photographer hard
at work, charmed to have something to take at last. We
questioned him eagerly, but he had only the vaguest notion as
to what was on foot. Anyway, here was copy, when the photographs
appeared in the London papers the editors could christen
them what they liked. And he rushed on in the wake of the ebb-tide,
snapshotting as he went.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_458"></a>[458]</span></p>

<p>The Bureau des Postes was our objective. There had been
brave doings there, so we had been told. But the spot, when we
reached it, appeared fairly peaceful. In a corner of the square a
little knot of people had collected round a tall Serbian officer,
while a weedy-looking Greek youth explained with some courage,
as it seemed to us from the looks of the bystanders, what proved to
be the true story of the arrest we had just witnessed.</p>

<p>He had been sitting quietly in that café there up the street,
everyone round him busy discussing the King’s fête, when a Greek
at the next table had shouted out, suddenly: ‘À bas le Roi!’
and then instantly jumped up and denounced the innocent Serbian
as the ill-wisher of Greece’s idol, and called loudly for the police—<i>lèse-majesté</i>
being as grave a crime in Greece as in Germany.
It was a put-up job.</p>

<p>The tall officer listened attentively, taking notes as he did so.
Then mounting his horse, he vanished after the photographer and
his prey.</p>

<p>We turned to the post-office at last to try and send a telegram
necessitated by my enforced change of plans. But for all its
peaceful air it was closely guarded. The imposing French ‘dragon’
at the entrance much regretted, but it was impossible for Madame
to do any such thing. ‘Why, what had happened?’ Ah, how
should he know? Those were his orders. A British Tommy at
another door proved equally correct, but less unbending. He knew
nothing officially, of course. ‘Oh, yes, the post-office had been
collared this morning—about time, too.’</p>

<p>‘There had been trouble, hadn’t there?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, bless you, no, Mum. They looked very fierce-like at first,
fired a few shots and all that, but when they saw we meant it,
came out as tame as a Macedonian tortoise.’ As to what was
happening inside, he knew no more than we did, but he ventured
to guess ‘The Frenchmen are going through Tino’s billets-doux
to the Bulgars all right.’</p>

<p>Now the crowd had melted the empty streets wore a curiously
menacing air. The grim black vistas of tightly closed iron doors
and shutters were more unpleasantly suggestive than the former
rioting and noise. Calling on a friendly Consul and his wife was
a work of some difficulty. Other unexpected sentries had to be
faced. It took time before the suspicious old Turkish concierge
would open the courtyard door wide enough to let us squeeze
through. The family party within were quite cheerful and unconcerned,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_459"></a>[459]</span>
but as Monsieur remarked when we were on the point
of leaving: ‘Ces émeutes arrivent souvent ici; nous avons eu trois
guerres. Je trouve c’est toujours mieux de rester chez soi.’</p>

<p>We took his advice. As we reached home I encountered the
Commander, delighted with the change. Now he could stop these
wretched local steamers blowing their sirens all day long below
his office windows. For there was more noise and fuss when a
coasting boat left the quay-side than the whole fleet of the largest
liners could possible require.</p>

<p>The English military band, which played to the populace
every Saturday afternoon, had become quite a feature of life at
Salonica; one could fancy oneself in a peaceful Anglo-Indian
station watching the curious semi-Oriental throng gathered at the
foot of the old White Tower—a tower built by the Venetians,
formerly part of the town walls, but now left stranded like a
huge rock in a child’s seashore garden.</p>

<p>The afternoon of the ‘émeute’ the White Tower looked strangely
quiet. Gone were the gaily-coloured crowds, the family parties of
Israelites and Dumés, the men in their historic furred gabardines
wearing the Moslem fez, their wives in their long satin coats and
brocade aprons—blue, prune, and violet, the favourite Jewish
colours—with curious green, parakeet-like head-dresses, low lace
bodices, and necklaces of many rows of seed pearls; the younger
women copying Athens and Paris in short skirts and high-heeled
yellow boots, for fashions change now the Turks have left.</p>

<p>No pipers played that afternoon to a delighted audience who
followed their every movement up and down. The soldiers and
sailors of the Allied nations, who usually collected to talk to their
friends while they listened to the music, were nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>The place was empty I thought as we reached it. But, no, among
the beds of pansies, stocks, and daisies and the carefully watered
little plots of grass, great, grey motor-lorries were drawn up. And
there were the French machine-gunners perched on their guns.
Very bored they looked, with a populace and soldiery which sat tight
behind its iron doors and shutters and wisely refused to come out.</p>

<p>A forest of blue and white flags, festooned with fir branches,
fluttered valiantly in the breeze. But no other sign of life and
festivity could be seen down the three main roads commanded by
the guns. There was nothing doing. As we passed, the soldiers
in field-blue were reduced to re-reading their month-old <i>Illustrations</i>
and <i>Petit Journals</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_460"></a>[460]</span></p>

<p>Under the pine trees in the little café garden beyond, at this
hour usually crammed with people, only two nursemaids gossiped
together, while their accompanying children and dogs played about
unrebuked in the sun.</p>

<p>A nervous-looking waiter brought us tea, having peeped out
cautiously and spied us sitting at one of his little tin tables close
to the sea-wall. The revolution was falling flat, we had given it
up, and were busy discussing the various possibilities of catching
a ship home—a matter of great moment to my present companion
fresh from six months unrelieved front trenches.</p>

<p>We had not been there long before a gardener appeared and
started his evening round of watering. The grass and flowers
must not suffer, whatever happened outside his domain. As he
came towards us I looked up and noticed that a few more people
had crept out and were moving about aimlessly. Then some soldiers
walked in carrying instruments; though late, there was to be a
band after all.</p>

<p>It settled itself, got out its music, struck up and was soon playing
merrily. But to our astonishment it was a Greek band this time—our
soldier and sailor musicians were otherwise occupied while
General Sarrail took the town. Since the early morning most of
the Greek troops had been shut up in their barracks, in case of
serious trouble. These must have been specially released. However
it was done, it was managed quite amicably, and as we left,
instead of an Allied band playing in a Greek seaport, this Saturday
afternoon here was a Greek band playing in a French enclave. The
‘émeute’ had ended. King Constantine’s fête-day was not without
music of sorts.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="WILLIAM_DE_MORGAN_A_REMINISCENCE"><i>WILLIAM DE MORGAN: A REMINISCENCE.</i></h2>

</div>

<p>One dark and snowy day last winter a distinguished company
met in the Old Church at Chelsea to do honour to the memory of
Henry James. Once more this January, under the same grey and
gloomy skies, with the same war-cloud hanging like a pall over the
land, another memorable gathering took place in the ancient riverside
shrine, when the last rites were paid to another illustrious
Chelsea resident, William De Morgan. Henry James, greatly as he
had endeared himself to us all and nobly as he had thrown in his
lot with England in these anxious times, had only recently made
his home in this neighbourhood, but William De Morgan had been
closely connected with Chelsea for nearly half-a-century. Chelsea
was the scene of his triumphs both in art and literature. Here he
set up his first kiln, in a garden at the back of Cheyne Row, and
here too, in later years, he wrote his famous novels.</p>

<p>His family was of French origin. He told me how one of his
Huguenot ancestors, four generations back, went out to India, and
married two Frenchwomen in succession. His son, Auguste De
Morgan, came over to England, settled here, and became the grandfather
of the distinguished mathematician, Augustus De Morgan,
who held the post of Professor of Mathematics at University College
for more than thirty years, and married the daughter of another
mathematician of note, the Cambridge Lecturer William Frend.
This Mrs. De Morgan was a remarkable woman, of cultured tastes,
whose beautiful face and lively interest in the people and things
about her made her still attractive in old age. She is fondly
remembered by many of her friends in Chelsea. Their eldest son,
William De Morgan, was born at 69 Gower Street in 1839, and
took up painting as a profession, before he turned his attention
to pottery. His sister, Mary De Morgan, who died eight or nine
years ago, was an able and talented woman—a marked contrast
to her brother in appearance, being small and slight, with a sharp
voice and abrupt manner. She amused people by her quick repartees
and witty sayings and wrote several fairy-tales, which
recalled Hans Andersen by their imaginative charm. The first of
these—‘On a Pincushion’—was published in 1877, and illustrated
with drawings by William De Morgan; the last—‘Wind-fairies’—appeared
in 1900, and was dedicated to Angela, Dennis, and Clare<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_462"></a>[462]</span>
Mackail, the grandchildren of Edward Burne-Jones. Mary De
Morgan also wrote a striking novel, called ‘A Choice of Chance,’
which was published in 1887, under the <i>nom de plume</i> of William
Dodson, a name which effectually concealed the writer’s identity.
The gift of story-writing was evidently in the family, although in
William De Morgan’s case it was to lie dormant for many years.</p>

<p>In 1871, on the death of his father, William De Morgan brought
his mother and sisters to live in Cheyne Row, two doors from Carlyle’s
home, and began to make his fine lustre-ware in a picturesque
old building known as Orange House. After his marriage to Miss
Evelyn Pickering in 1888, he settled in a charming old house in
The Vale, where he and his wife lived until it was pulled down more
than twenty years later, when they moved into a corner house
in Church Street. Their winters, however, were chiefly spent in
Florence, partly for the sake of De Morgan’s never robust health,
partly in order to be near his wife’s uncle, the painter, Spencer
Stanhope, who was a prominent member of the English colony
in that city. But after the death of this relative the ties which
bound the De Morgans to Florence were loosened, and in 1912
they finally gave up their Italian home to spend the whole year
in Chelsea.</p>

<p>From his early youth William De Morgan was the intimate
friend of Burne-Jones and William Morris, whose artistic aims and
tastes he shared, and was a frequent and welcome visitor at the
Grange and at Kelmscott House. His simple childlike nature, his
ready wit and love of fun, made him a great favourite with the
young people in both households. Lady Burne-Jones has told us
what an active part he took in their family life, both in joy and
sorrow, at one time amusing her children and their young cousin,
Rudyard Kipling, with his merry pranks, and on another occasion,
when she herself was dangerously ill, sitting up all night with her
distracted husband. And Miss May Morris remembers the delight
of her whole family when her father wrote to say that he was
bringing De Morgan back from town to spend a few days at
Kelmscott. De Morgan himself was never tired of recalling these
blissful summer holidays in the old Manor on the Upper Thames,
when he and Morris roamed up and down the lovely Cotswold
country in search of a suitable place for their workshops.
Eventually, in 1882, he built a factory for his tiles near Morris’s
works at Merton Abbey, and his jars and dishes of glowing ruby and
mother-of-pearl were always to be seen in the Morris Company’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_463"></a>[463]</span>
showrooms in Oxford Street. In beauty of shape and colour,
these lovely things recalled the wonderful Gubbio ware wrought
by Messer Giorgio in Renaissance times, while De Morgan’s Persian
tiles came so near to those which Lord Leighton brought from
Damascus to decorate his Arab court, that it was almost impossible
to detect any difference between the two.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in spite of its decorative charm and of the general
admiration which it aroused, De Morgan’s pottery never proved
a commercial success. This was partly due to the great cost of
production, and partly no doubt to his own lack of business capacity.
Like the French potter Palissy, whom in many ways he resembled,
De Morgan’s fertile brain was always busy with fresh ideas, always
starting out on untrodden tracks and attempting new experiments.
If one of these happened to prove successful, he promptly frittered
away his earnings in making fresh ventures on a new and grander
scale. His kindness and liberality to the workmen in his service
were unbounded. He took the deepest interest in their welfare,
and countless instances of his generosity to individuals are on
record.</p>

<p>During the winters which he spent abroad he was still busy
with new experiments and inventions, and set up a shop in his
garden in Florence, where he trained Italian workmen to paint
tiles with Persian colours under the glaze. But by degrees his
connection with the work ceased, and about ten years ago the
factory was closed and the moulds destroyed, to the great regret
of all lovers of art.</p>

<p>It was just at this moment, when William De Morgan was
already sixty-six, that he startled the world and amazed his most
intimate friends by revealing himself in a new and altogether unexpected
capacity. Suddenly, without any warning, the great
potter appeared before the public as a successful novelist. There
are comparatively few men in any age who have attained distinction
in two separate branches of art. Great poet-painters there have
been, it is true, such as Michelangelo in Italy of the Renaissance,
and Dante Rossetti in our own times, but there was generally
a close connection between their creations in the different arts.
Either the picture was inspired by the sonnet, or the verses gave
birth to the painting. It would be difficult to trace any connection
between De Morgan’s tiles and the novels which his prolific pen
poured forth in his later years. Yet, as I have often heard him
explain, his novels were indirectly the result of his work as a potter.
It was during these first fifty years of his life, when he was busily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_464"></a>[464]</span>
engaged in making experiments and looking about for boys and
men whom he could train to help him, that he acquired the
familiarity with the working classes and dwellers in the slums
which is one of the most striking features of his novels. The close
and daily contact into which he was brought with his own potters,
listening to their talk and watching them at work as he sat in a
corner of the factory making designs or meditating new inventions,
gave him that intimate knowledge of their habits and language,
that insight into the points of view and prejudices of their class
of which he writes with so much sympathy and kindly humour.</p>

<p>As a boy he remembered being told by his father, the professor
of mathematics, that he possessed some literary power, and that
if he applied himself to books he might do something in that line.
But in those early days, young De Morgan’s sole ambition was to
be a painter. So he entered the Academy school and, like Charles
Heath in ‘Alice-for-Short,’ gave up painting to design stained
glass, giving this up in turn when, about the age of thirty, he
started his experiments as a potter. But he never made any
attempt at original composition until he wrote his first novel,
‘Joseph Vance,’ when he was well on in the sixties.</p>

<p>It was at this interesting moment in De Morgan’s career, in
the summer of 1906, that I had the good fortune to meet him at a
country house, where he was staying with one of his oldest friends.
We had often met before, generally at Burne-Jones’ house, and as
I sat by his side at dinner we recalled those happy times and sighed
for the days and the friends that were no more. George Howard,
Lord Carlisle, who happened to be my other neighbour, joined in
our conversation and agreed with all De Morgan said of the brilliant
play of fantasy, the wit and tenderness, the indefinable charm which
made our beloved painter the most delightful companion in the
world. And with tears in his eyes, De Morgan said how it was
always thus in life. ‘We fail to realise the importance of the present
and let the good days go by, without any attempt to keep a record
of our friends’ words and actions, until it is too late.’ Towards the
end of dinner he dropped his voice and whispered that he had a
secret to tell me. ‘The fact is,’ he said, ‘I have perpetrated the
crime or the folly—whichever you choose to call it—of writing a
novel, which has just been published, and what is more wonderful
I have in my pocket a flattering review of the book, in to-day’s
<i>Spectator</i>!’ He went on to tell me how the story of ‘Joseph Vance’
had grown into being; how when he was ill and away in Florence, a
rheumatic hand disabled him from drawing, so he took to scribbling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_465"></a>[465]</span>
instead, and began to jot down ideas that came into his head, on
scraps of paper; how his wife encouraged him to go on with the
story; and how he became interested first of all in the character
of Christopher Vance, the drunken old builder, and then in that of
his heroine, ‘Lossie,’ till the actual writing became a pleasure and
the book took its present shape. The speaker’s earnestness and
animation, I remember, excited Lord Carlisle’s curiosity, and after
dinner he asked me if what he had caught of our conversation could
be true and De Morgan had really written a novel. There was no
denying the fact, and soon we were all reading ‘Joseph Vance’
and the friendly review which had given its author so much
satisfaction.</p>

<p>From the first the success of the book was phenomenal. The
girls in the office where the manuscript was typed became so much
absorbed in the story that they forgot to go on with their work.
The critics were unanimous in their chorus of praise, in spite of the
unusual length of the book, which at first seemed likely to prove a
stumbling-block. Mr. Punch pronounced ‘Joseph Vance’ to be
quite the best novel which he had read for a long time, and the
public on both sides of the Atlantic hailed the advent of a new
star in the literary horizon.</p>

<p>The plunge once made, William De Morgan went merrily on,
and novel after novel poured forth in rapid succession from his pen.
‘Joseph Vance’ was followed in 1907 by ‘Alice-for-Short,’ which
contains the author’s reminiscences of his experiences as an art-student,
and is dedicated to the memory of Edward Burne-Jones
and William Morris. Then came ‘Somehow Good,’ in which the
lively ‘Sally’ rivalled his first creation, ‘Lossie,’ in the affections
of the writer, as in those of his readers. Indeed, after the manner
of authors, De Morgan confessed that he had fallen in love with his
latest creation, but that he was not in the least responsible for Sally’s
erratic conduct, as she simply went her own way and did whatever
she liked with him. The wife’s meeting with her long-lost husband
was, he sometimes said, the passage by which he wished to be remembered,
just as Thackeray used to say that Becky Sharp’s pride in
her Guardsman was what he himself should select as the best thing
that he had written.</p>

<p>In 1909 De Morgan published a two-volume novel, ‘It Never can
Happen Again,’ which he dedicated to the memory of Ralph, second
Earl of Lovelace, ‘in remembrance of two long concurrent lives, and
an uninterrupted friendship.’ Lord Lovelace (who died in 1906) he
always said had been his earliest friend in Chelsea. His mother,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_466"></a>[466]</span>
Ada, daughter of Lord Byron, and first Countess of Lovelace, used
to study mathematics with Professor Augustus De Morgan, and
their children had known each other from the age of eight or nine.
This new book was hardly as successful as its predecessors, although
the episode of the blind beggar Jim and ’Lizer Ann was as fresh
and delightful as anything its author had ever written.</p>

<p>Lord Lovelace himself once aptly described De Morgan’s novels
as ‘the work of an idealist with realistic details,’ combining the
sentiments and traditions of the Victorian age with the more analytical
methods of the present generation. His sensitiveness to the
deep impressions left on the youthful mind by passing sights and
sounds, and to the strange way in which these trivial incidents weave
themselves about the great events of life, was a noteworthy feature
of De Morgan’s writings. Another striking feature of his novels was
the vigour and animation of the dialogue, whether he chronicles
the sayings of East-end beggars or West-end charwomen—a class
with which he seems to have possessed a close and intimate acquaintance—or
whether he sets down the lively prattle of Florentine
gardeners and barbers or the almost preternatural quickness of
repartee possessed by the small urchins of the slums. These are
all recorded in the writer’s own inimitable fashion, with the same
note of originality, the same gentle irony and warm sympathy,
together with a youthful optimism which never seemed to grow
old. Dickens, it has often been remarked, was the model on which
De Morgan fashioned his style, but there is less of caricature in the
characters which De Morgan draws, they are more real and human,
and always lovable. The digressions in which he often indulges,
taking the reader into his confidence and moralising on love and
parting, on death and a future life, seem rather to recall Thackeray.</p>

<p>In his next novel, ‘An Affair of Dishonour,’ which appeared
in 1910, De Morgan made a new departure. Leaving contemporary
England and London of the Victorian age, he placed the scene of
Sir Oliver and Lucinda’s adventures in the days of the Restoration,
and introduced a graphic account of the naval battle of Solebay
into the story. Several good judges rank this tale amongst the
author’s best efforts, but De Morgan himself was not of this opinion,
and when an admirer congratulated him on his new ‘tour de force,’
he replied ‘Say, rather, tour de faiblesse!’</p>

<p>The enforced break up of his old home in the Vale, Chelsea,
and the move to another house in Church Street, were serious
interruptions in De Morgan’s placid life, and when we met in the
following summer he told me that for the last six months he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_467"></a>[467]</span>
not been able to write a line, adding that it was perhaps just as
well, since during the last five years he had written and published
above a million and a quarter words! By the end of 1910, however,
he and his wife were happily settled in their new home, to
which they soon became deeply attached. That winter they spent
Christmas in London for the first time, and before long decided
to give up their house in Florence and make their home entirely
in Chelsea. Here they lived happily, surrounded by old friends
and their own beautiful works of art—De Morgan’s lustre-ware
and Persian tiles, and his wife’s pictures. Mrs. De Morgan was
an accomplished artist, and before her marriage her works appeared
for many years at the Grosvenor and New Gallery exhibitions.
Her industry was still as great as ever, and she went on painting
her pictures while De Morgan wrote his novels. Music was another
of their favourite occupations. They were regular attendants at
the Albert Hall Sunday Concerts and the musical afternoons at
Leighton House, and when they settled in Church Street De Morgan
found a new source of delight in the pianola. He became the
proud possessor of an Angelus, which he played all the evenings,
and declared that it first revealed Beethoven to him. But long
before this he had loved and studied the great master’s works,
and readers of ‘Joseph Vance’ will remember the fine passage in
which he describes the comfort that came to the bereaved widower
in a dark hour, through hearing a movement of the Waldstein
Sonata.</p>

<p>During the winter and spring of 1911 De Morgan found time
to write another short novel, called ‘A Likely Story,’ in which
he tried—not altogether successfully—to weave an Italian tale of
the sixteenth century into the modern life of Chelsea. But the
Italian part of the book is told with consummate art, and might
almost pass as the work of Bandello or Luigi da Porto.</p>

<p>There was, however, general rejoicing among the readers of
De Morgan’s novels when he returned to his older and more familiar
vein in his second two-volume novel, ‘When Ghost meets Ghost,’
which appeared early in 1914. The plot of the story turns on the
adventures of twin sisters, who are parted by a cruel fate in their
youth, and only meet again after interminable vicissitudes and
delays, when they are eighty years of age. This time his interest
in the tale and the pleasure which he took in elaborating every
detail carried him beyond his usual limits, and the story in its
original form made up over a thousand pages. When in response
to a gentle remonstrance from his publisher he succeeded in cutting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_468"></a>[468]</span>
out two hundred pages, he found it absolutely necessary to add
another fifty or sixty, ‘to fill up the gaps.’ But in spite of its
great length, much of the book was written in the author’s happiest
manner, and many of his critics placed it next to ‘Joseph Vance’
in their estimation.</p>

<p>The letters which he received on this occasion, as he said in
his quaint fashion, ‘greatly alimented his vanity.’ But he noticed
that most of his readers referred to ‘Joseph Vance’ as his best
book and to ‘Lossie’ as their favourite heroine. He confessed
that for his part ‘Janey’ was ‘his darling,’ and took great pains
to explain that she was not to be regarded as a ‘pis-aller,’ but as
the best possible helpmeet for Joseph Vance—the true wife of
his soul. One thing which surprised and gratified him extremely
was the warm appreciation expressed for his novels by so many
of the clergy—‘even Canons and Bishops’ of the Church of England,
‘in spite of all his heresies!’ It was in recognition of this kindly
attitude that he felt it necessary to introduce a good parson
into his novel, ‘It Never can Happen Again,’ in the person of the
Rector, Athelstan Taylor, who refutes the ‘ultra-liberal views’
expressed by Alfred Challis.</p>

<p>He came to the conclusion that what attracted ecclesiastics of
this description in his writings must be his ‘immortalism.’ As he
always insisted, he had a firm faith in an overruling Providence
which orders all things well, and in a future life where we shall
see and know our lost friends once more.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to know that the success of De Morgan’s novels
brought him the material rewards which his artistic pottery had
failed to command, and better still to feel how thoroughly he
enjoyed the fame and prosperity which had at length crowned his
labours. He took a child-like pleasure in the letters which reached
him from devoted admirers in all parts of the world, and often said
that he was quite ashamed of the magnificent sums which he received
from American publishers. The popularity of his novels showed
no signs of diminishing. Each one was awaited with the same
impatience, and in one instance a distinguished statesman who
knew that his days were numbered, begged to see advance proofs
of the forthcoming novel that was announced in the daily press, in
order that he might enjoy this last pleasure before his death.</p>

<p>In November 1910, De Morgan was the guest of honour at a
dinner given by the Society of Authors, but his gratification at the
compliment thus paid him was considerably damped when he
found that he was expected to make a speech! So nervous was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_469"></a>[469]</span>
he at the prospect that he would not allow Mrs. De Morgan to be
present, lest he should disgrace himself by breaking down. But,
although his voice at first sounded a little weak and quavering,
he got through the ordeal well, and amused his hearers by a good-humoured
allusion to a boycott which his last novel had sustained
at the hands of one of the largest circulating libraries, which had
rejected it as being improper. This, he suspected, was rather due
to the fact that he had outraged the feelings of circulating libraries
by venturing to publish a novel in two volumes. But he confessed
that he could not help feeling rather hurt at the treatment which
he had received, because of the singular respect that he had always
felt for libraries, ever since the day, sixty-six years before, when
his mother first took him, as a small boy, into Mudie’s Library. He
still remembered clearly how, as he stood with his chin resting on
the counter, he saw a tall gentleman step out from the back of the
shop and hand his mother a parcel of books. ‘That,’ said Mrs.
De Morgan, ‘was Mr. Mudie.’ He never forgot the thrill which
the words sent through him.</p>

<p>Long residence in Chelsea had made William De Morgan familiar
with its chief landmarks and leading inhabitants. He had known
Carlyle and Rossetti, Whistler and William Bell Scott, John Hungerford
Pollen and many other celebrities of past days. The historic
monuments in the Old Church, and the families whom they commemorate,
the Cheynes and Petitts, the Laurences and Danvers,
were a theme of which he was never tired. He mourned over the
destruction of the old wooden Battersea bridge that figured so
often in Whistler’s paintings and etchings. He had many stories
to tell of the part which it had played in the old life of Chelsea,
and of the health-giving properties associated with the structure
in the minds of former inhabitants. There was, it appears, a
popular superstition among Chelsea folk some fifty years ago that
seven currents of air met in the middle span of the bridge. A
carpenter who is still living vividly remembers being taken by his
mother to stand on the bridge, on a bitterly cold March day, with
his six brothers and sisters, who were all suffering from whooping-cough.
It must have been a case of kill or cure, but in this instance
the good woman’s faith seems to have been justified, for all her
seven children got over the whooping-cough and grew up hale and
hearty.</p>

<p>In spite, however, of his affection for Chelsea and its people, De
Morgan never forgot Italy and the Florentine home where he and
his wife had spent so many happy seasons. He missed the sun and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_470"></a>[470]</span>
the flowers and thought with regret of his friend Spencer Stanhope,
whose death had left so great a blank in the English colony at
Florence. Often he recalled the painter’s lovely home at Villa
Nuti, where the De Morgans always spent the week-end, and their
pleasant walks up the steep hillside, on radiant April mornings,
when Val d’Arno lay below in the first flush of spring loveliness.</p>

<p>One evening towards dusk I happened to meet him in Chelsea,
in front of a new Roman church which has been built of recent
years in Cheyne Row. The door stood open and we saw the priest
within reciting the office of Benediction, the clouds of incense
rising heavenwards and the gleam of silver and lighted candles
on the altar. ‘Ah!’ he said, ‘I like that, it makes me feel I am
at home again!’ And then it flashed across him that this church
stood on the exact spot where his first pottery kiln had been set
up, in the garden of Orange House; and so, as he said, ‘it really
was his home.’</p>

<p>The sudden outbreak of war, in August 1914, found the indefatigable
author busy with a new novel which promised to be
both original and entertaining. It was the story of his own recollections
of life in Chelsea during the last fifty years, put in the
mouth of an old pauper exactly his own age, who was supposed
to be living in the workhouse near his home. But, like many other
authors, De Morgan found it impossible to go on writing when his
whole soul was absorbed in the life and death struggle in which
the Empire found itself involved. The new novel was left unfinished,
but since a considerable part had been already written,
it is to be hoped that both this fragment, and another novel on
which he had been for some time engaged, may eventually see
the light.</p>

<p>During the next two years and a half, De Morgan thought of
little but the war. He followed every step of the campaign by
land and by sea, and did his utmost to enlighten public opinion
abroad and in the United States. More than this, he devoted
a great part of his time to making scientific experiments at the
Polytechnic and perfecting new discoveries, which might prove
useful in submarine warfare. All his old love for chemistry now
revived, and many were the suggestions for saving life and destroying
hostile craft which he sent to the Board of Admiralty.</p>

<p>The splendid optimism and youthful enthusiasm which were
so marked a feature of his character carried him safely through
the darkest days of the last two winters. He took keen interest
in an exhibition of his wife’s symbolical paintings dealing with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_471"></a>[471]</span>
subjects suggested by the war, which was held in Chelsea last
spring, and was very proud of the substantial sum which it realised
for the English and Italian Red Cross Societies. All through
these anxious months his familiar figure was frequently to be seen
in the streets of Chelsea. You met him in the morning doing his
own marketing and carrying provisions home, and late in the dusk
of evening he was constantly to be seen setting out on a rapid
walk along the Embankment. Often you caught sight of him
stopping at a street corner to exchange greetings with some old
inhabitant or engaged in earnest conversation with a soldier in
khaki just back from the front. The tall figure was slightly bowed
with advancing years, and Time had whitened the locks and beard
that were once a rich brown, but the brisk, alert step and clear
blue eyes with their frank, kindly glance, were still the same as
ever.</p>

<p>The last time I saw him he was singularly bright and hopeful.
He had thoroughly enjoyed a short September holiday at Lyme
Regis, and was eloquent on the beauty of the Dorset and Devon
coast. And he spoke with the utmost confidence of the coming
campaign on the Western front next spring. For him there could
be no doubt as to the final issue of the struggle. The devil was
let loose for a while and all the powers of evil were ranged against
us in the battle, but right must conquer in the end, he felt convinced,
and the hour of victory, he believed, was not far off. Alas!
he was not destined to see the day to which he looked forward with
such serene confidence. A sharp and sudden attack of influenza
carried him off after a fortnight’s illness, and on the 15th of January
he breathed his last. A few days later, a large company of the
friends who had known and loved him met in the Old Church, which
has played so great a part in the history of Chelsea and is so often
mentioned in his books. Here his mortal remains were laid under
a violet pall, bright with flowers, while sweet boy-voices sang his
last Requiem. Among the mourners were the children and grandchildren
of Burne-Jones and the daughter of William Morris.
So, with the music and flowers which he had loved, and with
familiar faces all around, he passed to his well-earned rest, followed
by the love and gratitude of thousands whose lives had been
cheered and gladdened by his genius.</p>

<p>That was how his mother found him when she came in search of him.
The lunch-gong had brought no Mark; and no one had seen him,
except Maurice, who, from his window, had caught sight of the
lovers entering the wood. All the morning she had been secretly
anxious. Now she felt certain something was wrong, and telling
the others not to wait, she fled out to his favourite haunt, hardly
knowing what she expected to find.</p>

<p>He did not hear her till she set foot in the summer-house; and
the wild idea smote him—Could it be Bel?</p>

<p>With a start he looked up; and at sight of his face Lady Forsyth’s
heart stood still.</p>

<p>‘My darling Boy, what <i>has</i> happened?’</p>

<p>Mark frowned and straightened his shoulders. ‘She’s chucked
me—that’s all,’ he said in a dazed voice. ‘They’ve poisoned her
point of view between them.’ His eyes challenged hers. ‘Mother,
you’ve been right all along. I suppose—you even foresaw—this!’</p>

<p>‘Dear, indeed I didn’t.’ Her hand closed on the rough woodwork.
She so longed to gather him to her heart. ‘I was anxious—a
little. But I hoped better things of her.’</p>

<p>‘So did I. We were a pair of fools, it seems. And there’s an
end of <i>that</i>.’ With a gesture he dismissed the subject, and added,
almost in his normal voice, ‘What about the meeting? Any
luck?’</p>

<p>‘Yes. People are quite keen. But—you’ll hardly feel like
speaking.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I’ll speak all right. The King’s affairs come a long way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_473"></a>[473]</span>
first. I’ve had enough of false perspectives this morning. I’ll
probably speak all the better for having—flung in everything.’
He sighed. ‘Give me to-morrow, Mums, to pull myself together,
and I’ll do any mortal thing that’s required of me. But I can’t
show up yet—you understand? And it’s you that must do the
telling—as before!’</p>

<p>A spasm of pain crossed his face and she passed a hand over his
hair.</p>

<p>He drew back sharply. ‘Oh—not that,’ he murmured; then
checked himself and tried to smile. ‘Sorry. I’m feeling—all raw,
Mother. I can’t be civil even to you.’ He could not tell her why
the feel of a woman’s hand on his hair was unendurable, and would
be, for some time to come.</p>

<p>‘I understand, dear,’ she said, and turned to go. ‘Shall I
send anything to the studio?’</p>

<p>He shook his head. ‘Later on, perhaps. Dinner time. You
might come up yourself.’</p>

<p>‘Of course I will.’</p>

<p>And so she left him.</p>

<p>Lunch was nearly over when she got back. They had kept some
hot for her; but she hardly touched it.</p>

<p>Briefly, without comment, she told them her news: and escaped
with Keith into the study. To him she could speak more freely.
He loved Mark like a brother; a good deal more, indeed, than the
average brother: and she knew—though neither had spoken of it—that
he had shared her distrust of Bel.</p>

<p>But her thoughts and her words were of Mark only as she stood
beside the man who so intimately shared their lives, her small hand
clenched upon the edge of the high mantelshelf; tears in her
eyes; but none in her voice.</p>

<p>‘He faces trouble so exactly like his father,’ she said, when she
had told him of Mark’s refusal to postpone the meeting. ‘But
Richard’s phlegm went deeper. Mark, underneath, has all my
terrible sensibility; though he won’t let me see it except accidentally.’</p>

<p>Keith said nothing. He was not given to superfluous comment;
and on the whole she found his silences more satisfactory than other
people’s talk. He knew she was more or less thinking aloud. She
was not even looking at him, but at a full-length photograph of her
husband—a powerful figure of a man.</p>

<p>‘It’s so strange,’ she went on in the same subdued tone. ‘I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_474"></a>[474]</span>
sometimes see Richard’s very self looking at me out of Mark’s eyes.
When the look comes I seem actually to feel him there. Twice
this morning I’ve seen it. Once when Mark spoke of war and again
when he spoke of—that wretched girl. Oh Keith—I hate her!’</p>

<p>The low voice broke unmistakably; and she bowed her forehead
on the back of her hand.</p>

<p>Macnair stood looking at her, his keen eyes clouded with tenderness.
A moment he seemed to hesitate, then deliberately, he laid
his hand on her shoulder. ‘Helen, don’t break your heart over it,’
he said. ‘We men pull through these things: and Mark is made
of sterner stuff, if I know him, than to let a girl like Miss Alison
smash him up for good. More likely to do that by marrying him
than by leaving him. There’s a crumb of consolation for you!’</p>

<p>She raised her head now and smiled at him through tears that
were not allowed to fall.</p>

<p>‘If there is such a crumb anywhere, trust you to find it! What
a blessing you are to us, Keith!’ As his hand slipped from her
shoulder she caught and held it a minute. Then her thoughts went
back to her son. ‘I wonder—will he ever have eyes for Sheila
again, after this?’</p>

<p>‘More likely after this than before. Sheila’s a born mother-woman,
a little Sister of Compassion. And we men are such fools,
that we’re very apt to overlook the beauty of that type till we’ve
suffered a few hard knocks from the other sort. The revulsion from
that type, when it comes, is curiously complete. But it takes time.
As for our Sheila, whether she would have him, after this, is another
matter.’</p>

<p>Helen sighed. ‘I can’t forgive Maurice yet,’ she said. ‘I
wonder if he’ll enlist?’ And their talk slid back to the one all-absorbing
subject—the War.</p>

<p class="tb">As for Mark, he spent that interminable afternoon tramping
endlessly, aimlessly over the hills; hoping by the mechanical
motion to deaden thought and ease the pain within. Where all
memory was intolerable, it hurt him most to recall how cruelly
she had tempted him by tone and touch; as it were bribing him
to be false to his own convictions. The whole thing bewildered
almost as much as it hurt him. There were moments when he
came near to hating her; proof, though he did not realise it, that
the love she evoked was strongly tinctured with baser metal.</p>

<p>And all the while Bobs, the incurably faithful, trotted to heel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_475"></a>[475]</span>
or gambolled coquettishly under his master’s eyes without eliciting
a word or caress.</p>

<p>Hunger and lengthening shadows drew him back at last to the
home he loved yet now acutely desired to avoid. She had poisoned
even that. Yet how his heart ached for her! How the unregenerate
blood in his veins craved the touch of her lips and hands!</p>

<p>He reached his study without encountering anything more
human than a stray housemaid; and there the first thing he
lighted on was his own tender and beautiful little Study of Contemplation.
Standing just inside the door, he feasted his eyes on
the soft, still face, the small head with its close-fitting cap of hair
and the long-limbed grace of her figure. Then rage flamed in him.
He felt like smashing the thing with a hammer and flinging away
the pieces as he had flung away her ring. A mere pulse-beat of
hesitation saved him and the artist prevailed over the man. He
could not murder the work of his hands. Later on, he would give
it to Maurice to wean him from the sin of impressionism. Meanwhile,
he lifted it as tenderly as he would have touched the original,
put it away in a corner cupboard and turned the key.</p>

<p>He had scarcely done so when he heard his mother outside.</p>

<p>‘Open the door, dear,’ she said. ‘My hands are full.’</p>

<p>He opened it and relieved her of a tray set out with appetising
food and wine.</p>

<p>‘Stunning of you, Mums,’ he said. ‘I’m hungry.’</p>

<p>To her delight he ate everything and drank three glasses of wine,
while they discussed ways and means; the money they could realise,
the men they could raise for England in this most critical hour of
her destiny. Except for the absence of laughter and badinage in
their talk, it was as if nothing abnormal had happened. But Lady
Forsyth did not fail to note the disappearance of his terra-cotta
treasure; and she was sinful enough to hope it had been destroyed.</p>

<p>She stayed more than half an hour and left him with a fervent
‘God bless you!’ But this time she attempted no caress. She
understood.</p>

<p class="tb">Next morning, after breakfast, she lingered in her turret room,
wondering what he would do with himself, hoping he would come
and let her know. He did come; and her heart ached at the tired
look in his eyes.</p>

<p>‘I’m going to take the “Watersprite” up the loch, Mums,’ he
told her. ‘And I’ll be away all day. Grant has stocked her well, so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_476"></a>[476]</span>
I shan’t starve. Don’t be an idiot if I’m late and go imagining I’ve
drowned myself. At a time like this, a man’s life is not his own to
chuck away. Besides, I’m not the sort. And—there happens to be
you,’ he added with a travesty of a smile. ‘On the whole I’d sooner
have the honour of being shot by the Germans—’</p>

<p>‘Mark—don’t!’ She drew in a sharp breath.</p>

<p>‘Sorry, Mums. But it’s true. By the way, as I’m wasting some
valuable time hadn’t we better stay over Sunday?’</p>

<p>‘That <i>would</i> make things easier,’ she admitted. ‘But I thought—you’d
rather get away soon.’</p>

<p>‘My dear Mother, don’t fash yourself with fancies. If it’ll
ease things, we’ll jolly well stay. <i>I</i> don’t care a damn.’</p>

<p>The spark of irritation was purely refreshing: and he never
apologised to her for ‘language’ accidental or otherwise. So complete
was the comrade spirit between them that he prided himself
on his habit of speaking to her straightly as man to man. More
than once, in University days, he had filled some prospective
visitor with envy by the casual remark: ‘Don’t be alarmed if you
hear me scrapping with my Mother. She’s the right sort. I can
talk to her just exactly as I talk to you.’</p>

<p>Now, in answer to his outburst, she said quietly: ‘Very well,
Monday. I’ll tell the others.’</p>

<p>‘That’s all right. And don’t you be a fool about me!’</p>

<p>So he left her and she did her best to obey him; but the faint
consolation that his trouble brought him nearer to herself was
obliterated by her acute consciousness of his hidden pain and resentment
against the cause of it.</p>

<p>That grey, weary Thursday seemed as if it would never pass.
Clouds had rolled up out of the West. Scudding showers lashed
the loch; and through them she could picture Mark driving the
little steam-yacht he loved. Long after sunset he came back wet
to the skin; but looking, on the whole, more like himself. He
had fought and conquered something out there in the rain and wind.
But he spent what remained of the evening in his studio as before.</p>

<p>On Friday evening, when they were gathered in the square hall
waiting to start, he strode casually down stairs and nodded his greetings
as if he had merely been away for a couple of nights. He had
prepared a speech, he said, that ought to make the men of Ardmuir
sit up to some purpose: and Keith, watching the little incident from
the study threshold, murmured: ‘Well done, old boy!’</p>

<p>A second car had been ordered to accommodate the party; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_477"></a>[477]</span>
while they made ready, Mark was left momentarily alone with Sheila
in the hall.</p>

<p>Then she took courage and looked up at him.</p>

<p>‘Mark—I’m so sorry,’ she whispered. ‘I may say that much,
mayn’t I?’</p>

<p>For a second he held her gaze. Then: ‘You may say anything
you please,’ he answered, ‘when you look like that! Truth is,’ he
paused, ‘she’s never been taught to see things the right way. It
was just—that one couldn’t make her understand.’</p>

<p>‘Poor Bel! She must be very unhappy.’</p>

<p>‘Bel—unhappy!’ His astonishment was manifest. But then—Sheila
had not seen the look in her eyes. ‘I doubt it,’ he added
with a touch of bitterness.</p>

<p>‘<i>I</i> don’t,’ the soft voice persisted. ‘She’s bound to be—if she
cares.’</p>

<p>‘But if she cared, how <i>could</i> she—?’</p>

<p>The note of pain in his voice gave her still more courage.</p>

<p>‘You said—she didn’t understand, and that poisons everything.’</p>

<p>Touched to the heart he said impulsively ‘Sheila, what a wise
little Mouse you are!’</p>

<p>It was his old nickname for her and she drew in a quick breath.
‘Not so very! But I do know—about caring.’</p>

<p>‘The first best knowledge surely,’ he said: then Keith appeared
and bade them hurry up.</p>

<p>But her eyes, shining on him through tears, and her words that
gave him a new point of view lingered in his memory. Odd how
readily he could speak of Bel to Sheila, how hardly to his mother,
with whom he could talk of everything in earth or heaven. And
surely no one but Sheila could have been inspired to couple sympathy
for himself with so tender and delicate a plea for Bel. If she were
right, if Bel were really suffering, the door of hope might still be
ajar. Meantime there was his speech; for which he had made
comprehensive notes; there were convictions and appeals that he
must drive home to the hearts of his hearers; and while he sat
smoking in silence beside Keith—who drove the car—words full of
vigour and fire came crowding into his brain—</p>

<p>When at length he stood on the platform waiting for his clamorous
welcome to subside, the flame of his own conviction burnt away
all nervousness, all dread of failure; and for half an hour he spoke
as none had imagined he could speak, himself least of all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_478"></a>[478]</span></p>

<p>‘First rate,’ Keith said quietly as he sat down amid a storm of
cheers.</p>

<p>‘Heaven knows how I did it!’ he answered under cover of the
noise. ‘Wish I could bolt now.’</p>

<p>But the Provost had risen and was praising him to his face; a
far worse ordeal than the one he had so triumphantly weathered.
The recruiting result, in figures, was not sensational: but Ardmuir
was obviously impressed. It begged leave to distribute Sir Mark’s
‘great recruiting speech’ as a leaflet; and Sir Mark, privately overwhelmed,
gave gracious consent, with the air of one who made
brilliant speeches as easily as he ate his breakfast.</p>

<p>‘Really, old boy, you ought to stand for Parliament,’ Keith said
as they drove home. ‘If that speech of yours is well distributed, the
men will soon be tumbling in. One has to give them time up
here. The Radical spirit is so strong in our beloved country.’</p>

<p>‘And the beauty of it is that the bulk of ’em, if they only knew
it, remain Radicals just <i>because</i> they’re so conservative!’ Mark
retorted with a flash of his mother’s humour. ‘But Parliament—no
thanks; not yet awhile.’</p>

<p>Saturday was given over to rounding up his own men and business
connected with his mother’s small estate. That evening he
conquered, not without difficulty, a temptation to stroll down into
the village and discover whether the Rowans was yet empty of its
treasure; and when the last post came in he knew.</p>

<p>Glancing through half a dozen envelopes, he came suddenly on
Bel’s handwriting. His mother, who was watching him, saw,
without appearing to see, that he pocketed all his letters unopened
and, after a reasonable interval, rose and left the room. It was
easy to guess what had happened; and she rated herself for the
horrid sinking at her heart. She could not sleep till she knew;
but as Mark did not reappear, she went up early and, in passing,
knocked at his door.</p>

<p>‘Good-night, dear,’ she said.</p>

<p>He opened it and stood before her—transfigured.</p>

<p>‘Come along in, Mums.’ Drawing her forward he closed the
door behind her. ‘Read that!’</p>

<p>He thrust a faintly scented sheet of note-paper into her hand,
and she obeyed.</p>

<p>Bel’s communication was brief, moving, and very much to the
point.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Are you generous enough to forgive me—and come to me?’
she wrote without preamble. ‘If you can keep it up—<i>I can’t</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_479"></a>[479]</span>
I saw and heard you at Ardmuir. You are <i>brave</i>. As for me,
I’m bitterly sorry and ashamed. I hate it all still. But if you
wish it, I am yours—unconditionally, <span class="smcap">Bel</span>. I shall be alone here
after 10.30. I can’t face Inveraig.’</p>
</div>

<p>Lady Forsyth had to read that note more than once before she
could feel sure of her voice. To her it seemed studied, consciously
written for effect: and the writing itself was equally studied, with
the same touch of hardness in it that showed in the level line of
eyelids and brows.</p>

<p>‘Well?’ Mark was growing impatient.</p>

<p>‘You <i>can</i> forgive her?’ she asked, looking steadily up at him.</p>

<p>‘Of course I can. And you must too. She’s sorry. She—cares.
Isn’t that enough for anyone?’</p>

<p>‘But she’s not convinced.’</p>

<p>‘<i>I’ll</i> convince her, in time. I hope she’ll come south with us
to-morrow.’</p>

<p>Lady Forsyth drew in her lips and at once his hands came down
on her shoulders.</p>

<p>‘Look here, Mums, I <i>won’t</i> have you antagonising and doubting
her any more—after this. It spoils everything. You might make
an effort if only for my sake. It’s beyond belief getting her back;
and your attitude’s the only flaw in my happiness. Has been all
along.’</p>

<p>She was silent a minute, then she put her two hands on his breast.
‘Dear, I will make an effort for your sake. I refuse to be the flaw
in your happiness! It’s a degrading position for a mother.’</p>

<p>He stooped and kissed her for the first time since Wednesday
morning. ‘Bless you!’ he said. ‘Good-night.’</p>

<p>Alone in her room, confronting this new, unwelcome development,
she realised how, through all the pain of his grief, she had
been upheld by the secret conviction that his loss was gain; some
day he would know it. Now the old miserable uncertainty was
nagging at her afresh. In her heart, she distrusted the sincerity
of the whole incident. But she had given her word to Mark, and
Bel should have the benefit of all the doubts in creation.</p>

<p class="tb">Mark’s watch was three minutes short of the half-hour when he
stood outside the square grey house perched on the hillside above
the road. A white curtain fluttered; and a glimpse of Bel’s face
signified that the coast was clear.</p>

<p>When he entered the homely sitting-room and closed the door<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_480"></a>[480]</span>
she did not run to meet him as a simpler woman would have done.
She remained standing near the mantelpiece on the farther side of
the square table, smiling her cool provocative smile.</p>

<p>‘Mark!’ she said softly. ‘I’ve been wondering and wondering
would you really come?’</p>

<p>By that time the square table was no longer between them
and Mark was holding her as if he could never let her go.</p>

<p>‘Would you have broken your heart, if I hadn’t?’ he asked at
last.</p>

<p>‘Very nearly!’ she admitted, with the slowest possible lift of
her lashes.</p>

<p>‘But, Bel—if you cared, how <i>could</i> you pull it through? How
could you look at me with your eyes like bits of glass?’</p>

<p>‘You forget,’ she said, ‘I can act. It was because—I cared
so much; because I couldn’t bear the idea of your taking part in
that horror out there; and because you were so obstinate, that in
the end I put on the strongest screw I could think of—and it wasn’t
so strong as I supposed. That’s the inner history of the last three
days.’</p>

<p>He regarded her searchingly, taking it all in. ‘Women are
queer things,’ he said. ‘Did you really suppose I’d capitulate—under
the screw?’</p>

<p>‘I half hoped so—till I heard your speech. Then I began to
see that I’d never known the real Mark: only Bel’s lover.’</p>

<p>‘And—did you approve of the real Mark?’</p>

<p>She laughed and kissed him.</p>

<p>‘Honestly, I found him rather alarming. Too big altogether
for a mere Bel. But I wanted him more than ever. And now I
know he’s still mine, I can’t let him go!’</p>

<p>For Mark there was only one flaw in those first raptures of
reunion: and for that flaw his mother was unwittingly responsible.
Nothing would induce Bel to come up to Inveraig or to travel
south with the Forsyths on Monday.</p>

<p>‘I can’t face them yet awhile,’ she persisted, ‘specially your
Mother. She won’t easily forgive me for hurting you so. No real
mother could. Besides, she was probably thanking her stars for
your escape; and now I’ve turned up again, like a bad penny!’</p>

<p>‘Bel!’</p>

<p>But she laid her hand upon his lips.</p>

<p>‘Hush and listen to me. It wouldn’t be fair on Harry either;
stranding her with those two. In ten days, we can both come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_481"></a>[481]</span>
south and a regenerate Bel can dare to pay you a visit. Their
minds will be full of such big terrible things by then that they’ll
take me for granted. As for you—the real Mark will be so swamped
with his responsibilities that there would be no time for love-making,
even if I came.’</p>

<p>In the end he was forced to admit that she was right. Three
days of fighting himself had not been without a steadying effect
on his impatient spirit: and so the matter was settled.</p>

<p>Rain and wind had ceased. They spent all the afternoon and
evening together on the water; and on Monday the Forsyth
party travelled down to Wynchcombe Friars.</p>

<p>At no time could Lady Forsyth leave Inveraig without a pang:
and never had it been sharper than on that 10th of August with
the glory and anguish of Belgium’s gallant stand beating on her
brain, and the poignant question at her heart—when, and in what
circumstances, would they four see that grey rugged house and the
lochs and hills of Scotland again?</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p>Wynchcombe Friars was a singularly perfect relic of the Tudor
period. It rambled, it blossomed into irrelevant gables, it took
you to its heart. The lordly spaciousness of an eighteenth-century
mansion seemed dull, featureless, by contrast with its individuality,
its friendly charm. And of all its beautiful old rooms was none
more individual than Mark’s studio, with its oak-panelled walls, deep
window-seats and leaded casements that opened upon the sea of
pinetops he had described to Bel. For him and his mother, it was
the soul of the house; and in nothing was their intimacy more
evident than in the fact that this, his holy of holies, was hers also.
A certain square bay window that caught the last of the sun
upon the pines held her armchair of dull blue brocade, her
book-case and elbow table. Blue prevailed also in the window-seats,
the casement curtains and the Turkish rugs on the polished
floor.</p>

<p>The studio itself contained little beyond Mark’s paraphernalia,
his writing-table and a few pieces of priceless old furniture. The
spirit of Michael Angelo pervaded the place:—models of his statues
and groups, sepia studies by Mark from the great friezes; and a
portrait of the Florentine’s rugged head occupied the place of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_482"></a>[482]</span>
honour above the mantelpiece. The blue-tiled fireplace beneath
was flanked by Mark’s first two essays in statuary: symbolic
figures of Triumph and Defeat. Triumph, a splendid nude, stood
poised upon a rock; arms uplifted, head flung back. Defeat,
a fallen Lucifer, still sullenly defiant, leaned upon his battered
sword; a figure of sombre strength. The Viking, who accompanied
Mark on his moves, was set in a dark oak niche that served
for frame and threw him into strong relief.</p>

<p>Still, beneath all the beauty and friendliness of the room, there
lurked the same unobtrusively ascetic note that had been more
marked in the simpler studio at Inveraig.</p>

<p>So at least thought Maurice Lenox, who lounged smoking in
an armchair, wondering, secretly, how Mark could bring himself
to leave it all, patriotism or no. He, personally, had found it
quite enough of a wrench to shut up his modest rooms in Chelsea—till
when? God, or the devil, alone could tell.</p>

<p>He had gone straight from Inveraig to his home in Surrey,
wondering what possible use there could be for such as he in this
terrible <i>galère</i>:—he, who had small knowledge of firearms and so
heartily detested taking life that he could not even find pleasure in
fishing. Mark had suggested enlisting in the Artists’ Rifles:
a suggestion since confirmed by Sir Eldred Lenox, with a blunt
admonition to look sharp about it. Sir Nevil Sinclair, of Bramleigh
Beeches, commanded them. He would send the boy’s name
up for a commission the moment he was reasonably fit for it: and
on the whole Maurice found it a relief to have the question of choice
taken out of his hands. He had stipulated for a few days of his
promised visit to Wynchcombe Friars, before taking the plunge;
and those few days—with Macnair for the only other guest—had
laid the foundation of a genuine friendship with Forsyth, whose
finer qualities shone out notably in this hour of crisis.</p>

<p>Whereas at Inveraig he had at times seemed selfish and a trifle
dictatorial, here, as responsible landowner, his mastery and force of
character showed in a new light. And as for selfishness—his whole
mind seemed set upon the welfare of his people and his place in the
coming time of stress. Now, at the very moment when he was
most needed, and most longed to be on the spot, he was cheerfully
and actively engaged in transferring the reins of government into
other hands. To Maurice—a man of random moods and many
points of view—such strength and singleness of purpose seemed
enviable as it was admirable; and the fact that Forsyth had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_483"></a>[483]</span>
remained unshaken even by Miss Alison’s defection had made a
deep impression on the lighter nature of his friend. Since then, he
had learnt a good deal more, not only of Sir Mark in a fresh manifestation,
but of England’s greatest asset—sadly misprized in a
democratic age—the hereditary lords of the land.</p>

<p>To-day his brief respite was over.</p>

<p>At the moment, he and Mark had effected their escape from the
infliction of war-talk, as perpetrated by Mrs. Melrose and the Vicar’s
wife, at the tea-table on the terrace. Sir Mark’s sudden engagement,
by the way, had been a severe shock to Mrs. Melrose, who
suspected that Sheila must have played her cards remarkably ill.
But that, after all, was how one might expect her to play cards
of any worldly value. She was her Melrose grandmother all over.
Not a drop of Burlton blood in her veins. But the war had dwarfed
that personal disappointment: and the good lady was brimming
with benevolent schemes for herself and the whole neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Meantime the Vicar’s wife held the field. Having come in quest
of a subscription, she had stayed to murmur decorous and very
premature lamentations over the undesirable features of billeting
and of the Territorial camps: the sort of thing that reduced Lady
Forsyth to speechless exasperation. Mark, divided between sympathy
and amusement, had watched her holding herself in, till the
assertive voice of Mrs. Melrose created a diversion and dubious
murmurs were drowned in a flood of propositions for the local
housing of Belgians and the conversion of Wendover Court into a
luxurious hospital for officers.</p>

<p>‘<i>You</i>, Lady Forsyth, with this heavenly place, ought to specialise
on convalescents or nerve-cases’—Mrs. Melrose dearly loved making
other people’s plans—‘If we all take a <i>distinctive</i> line, there’ll be
no muddle or overlapping. And of course <i>dear</i> little Lady Sinclair
will devote herself to the Indians—when they come.’</p>

<p>Privately Helen reflected that if her neighbours continued so to
afflict her, the first nerve-case for Wynchcombe Friars would be its
own mistress.</p>

<p>It was at this point that Mark had given up waiting for the
Sinclairs. Not even the presence of Sheila—who had come over
with her mother and was staying on to discuss ‘War plans’—could
detain him, once Mrs. Melrose held the field. Basely
deserting Lady Forsyth he left word that Sir Nevil, if he should
turn up, would be very welcome in the studio.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_484"></a>[484]</span></p>

<p>Now, while Maurice lounged and reflected, he sat at his littered
writing-table, a pipe between his teeth, two deep furrows in his forehead.
Beyond that littered table the room held no other signs of
work. Easel and modelling pedestal stood empty. A woeful tidiness
prevailed, and Mark himself looked older, Maurice thought.
Small wonder, seeing all that he must forgo at a stroke when his
name appeared in the ‘Gazette.’</p>

<p>So, throughout Great Britain, in the same casual unemotional
fashion, men of every grade were making the supreme sacrifice,
cheerfully putting behind them all that made life worth living—possessions,
talents, hardly earned distinction, cherished hopes
and still more cherished homes. No doubt many of them, like
Maurice, privately rebelled; but they, too, were carried forward by
the infection of brave example, if by no higher motive. In Mark’s
company, Maurice had felt that infection strongly: but on this his
last evening of freedom the artist in him raged afresh against the
hideousness and waste and cruelty of modern war.</p>

<p>For ten minutes Mark had been smoking steadily and silently.
He had a difficult letter on his mind. Maurice, who had the horrors
of Tirlemont on his nerves, felt suddenly impelled to more candid
speech than he had hitherto indulged in, lest he be misjudged.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know what your private feelings are, Forsyth,’ he
plunged boldly; and Mark started as if he had been waked from a
dream. ‘But the more I look at this business of enlisting and
going out to slaughter Germans—not to mention the chance of their
returning the compliment—the more heartily I hate the whole thing.
It’s nothing so simple as mere funk. And it’s not that I’m shirking—you
understand.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, yes. I understand,’ Mark rejoined, setting his teeth on
the stem of his pipe.</p>

<p>But he did not seem disposed to enlarge on his understanding of
his private feelings; and Maurice, whose mixed emotions were
clamouring for expression, went on: ‘Mere funk would at least
give one something to tackle and overcome. It’s this cursed
inferno going on inside one’s head that does the damage. And
the beastly thing seems quite independent of one’s thoughts or
attention. Just keeps on automatically at the back of my brain.
Even when I’m reading or talking, I can hear those infernal guns
and shells. I can see the mangled fragments that once were men—the
wounds—the blood—the slopes of the Liége forts—’</p>

<p>‘Damn you! Shut <i>up</i>!’ Mark leaned forward suddenly, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_485"></a>[485]</span>
spark of anger in his eyes. ‘D’you suppose you’re the only one
that’s plagued with an imagination?’</p>

<p>Maurice sighed.</p>

<p>‘Sorry, old chap,’ he said, disappointed, but contrite. ‘It’s a
relief all the same. And I thought—you understood—’</p>

<p>‘Of course I do: a long sight too well.’ Mark’s tone was gentler
now. ‘If it’s relief you’re after, you’ll get that most effectively by
going out yourself; seeing things with your actual eyes: doing
things with your actual hands that’ll give you no time for cinematographs
in your head. You can thank your stars you’re a <i>man</i>.
It’s the women given that way who’ll have the devil’s own time of
it. My mother’s one, worse luck; and it’ll come hard on her—when
I’m gone.’</p>

<p>Maurice ventured no comment on a subject so poignantly intimate
as Lady Forsyth’s anxiety for her one remaining son; nor did
Mark seem to expect any. He took a few pulls at his pipe, then reverted
to generalities.</p>

<p>‘Don’t write me down an unfeeling brute, Maurice,’ he said
with his friendly smile. ‘War’s the roughest game on earth and
we’ve got to be a bit rough with ourselves if we’re to play it to any
purpose. I’m horribly well aware that the “sorrowful great gift
of imagination” is the very deuce on these occasions. A shade less
of it in us, who have to do the killing, and a shade more of it in
our Westminster Olympians—who have to do the foreseeing and
forestalling—would be a pleasanter business for ourselves and a
better look-out for the country. They’re an agile crew with their
tongues; and if words were bullets, we might be in Berlin the week
after next! Personally, I’d like to see most of ’em scrapped “for
the duration of the war.” Kitchener paramount, with a picked
Council, would pull us through in half the time. But that’s not
my business nor yours. It’s for us to play up all we can; thank
God for one real Man, and not waste our precious energies in
grumbling. There’s a sermon for you. And you brought it on
yourself!’</p>

<p>Maurice rose, flung away his cigarette end, and strolled down
the length of the room and back.</p>

<p>‘It’s done me a power of good being here,’ he said, coming to a
standstill by the mantelpiece and contemplating Mark’s ‘Triumph.’
‘You’re a man as well as an artist, Forsyth; and the bulk of us are
not; I, personally, am cursed with too much of Uncle Michael in
my composition.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_486"></a>[486]</span></p>

<p>Mark laughed.</p>

<p>‘Confound your Uncle Michael! You run along and enlist and
kill every German you can lay hands to and your composition will
take care of itself. A wee bit stiffening’s all you want; and a wee
bit taste of red-hot reality will put some backbone into your studio-bred
art, that ennobles nothing and nobody and doesn’t even want
to make itself understood. It’s just on the cards that this war—when
we’re through with it—may give us an altogether saner and
more robust revival of art that will spring naturally from a more
robust conception of life: an art that will genuinely reflect the
spirit of the age, as Michael Angelo reflects the Renaissance. Our
present age of machinery and money-getting has precious little
spirit to reflect. No collective convictions. Practically no faith,
except in success. Consequently life has no vital use for art: and
we’re ousted by the cinematograph. A few, like myself and Sinclair,
still hang on to beauty and the classics. The rest, like the
bulk of your advanced friends, say “Ugliness, be thou my beauty”
and proceed to make a little hell of their own in the Grafton Galleries!
Just at present, Maurice, the mere artist is the most superfluous
creature on God’s earth....’</p>

<p>He suddenly laughed and checked himself. ‘Off on my hobby-horse
again! Why the deuce don’t you chuck a book at me, old
chap? Too much spouting at these recruiting shows will make me
an infliction to my friends. Ah—there goes Mrs. Melrose! Joy for
Mother! Likewise the devout Mrs. Clutterbuck, who thinks to
advertise her own virtue by maligning better folk than herself.
Come on down. We’ll get the tail-end of tea and the poor dears
will need cheering up.’</p>

<p>They found the poor dears in very fair spirits—considering.
Helen was delighted at recapturing Sheila; and the girl herself made
no secret of her distaste for the restless superficial activities of her
own home. A telegram from Sir Nevil Sinclair explained his non-appearance
and begged Mark not to fail him at the Bramleigh
meeting next day. Then, tea being removed and the others dispersed,
Mark found himself alone with Sheila, whom he had scarcely
seen since the day of Bel’s regeneration.</p>

<p>‘It’s good to get you back again, Mouse,’ he said, with brotherly
directness: and as she merely smiled without looking up, he
allowed his eyes to linger on her face. ‘But I’m not sure I approve
of the massage plan, specially if it means careering off to France
with Miss Videlle.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_487"></a>[487]</span></p>

<p>Sheila hesitated. ‘I thought—if you married—there might
be Bel. But if Mums really needs me, I’d leave anything, anyone
... for her. She knows that.’ The girl’s voice throbbed with
feeling and a faint colour showed in her cheeks. ‘I’m very doubtful,
though, whether she could or would stay here long—without
you.’</p>

<p>Mark started and frowned.</p>

<p>‘She must! She’ll be safe here; and there’s no end of useful
work for her on the spot. All the same—’ he paused, looking
deep into the heart of the wood, at pine-stems rosy with shafts
of light. ‘I believe you know best. She won’t stop. She’d
break her heart. War comes cruel hard on the women.’</p>

<p>Sheila said nothing: but the set of her lips showed a faint line
of strain that he had not noticed before. ‘Come for a quarter-deck
prowl with me, Mouse,’ he said.</p>

<p>They paced the wide-flagged terrace, veined with moss, till
near dinner-time; and only at the last did Mark speak the thought
uppermost in his mind. They had reached the far end when he
came to a standstill and faced her squarely.</p>

<p>‘Sheila—it goes against the grain asking favours for Bel,
even of you and Mother; but you were such a brick before; and
now—it’s a bit of an ordeal for her facing you all after—what
happened up there. Otherwise she’d have been here sooner. Of
course I’ll make her speak to Mums straight away, which may clear
the air, between them. But I want you all to be ever so kind and
not let her feel a shadow of awkwardness. Just pick up the threads
again as if nothing had happened. Will you—for my sake?’</p>

<p>Sheila was leaning now against the balustrade, her hands pressed
palm downwards on the stone work.</p>

<p>‘Yes, Mark,’ she said in an odd, contained voice, ‘I’ll do anything
I can for your sake. But in my heart—’ she suddenly
looked up at him with her clear honest eyes, ‘I can’t forgive her—<i>ever</i>!’</p>

<p>‘<i>You?</i>’ His surprise brought the blood to her cheeks. ‘But
when it happened you were so—understanding. It was you who
took the edge off my bitterness.’</p>

<p>‘Because then—I didn’t understand,’ Sheila explained with
difficulty. ‘I thought she had really lost you through her own
blindness; and—I was sorry for her. But afterwards, one couldn’t
help suspecting it was all ... that perhaps she was simply ...
putting on the screw.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_488"></a>[488]</span></p>

<p>‘She admitted as much,’ he said, looking away across the rose
garden.</p>

<p>‘Mark! How <i>could</i> she?’ Her low tone vibrated like a
smitten harp-string.</p>

<p>‘That’s the mystery to a masculine brain. It hurt—considerably.
But it seems women do these things.’</p>

<p>Sheila checked a natural impulse to repudiate the sweeping
assertion. She saw him deliberately erecting a screen for Bel, at
the expense of others; but she had already been candid enough,
and she would not permit herself to insinuate disparagement.</p>

<p>Her enigmatical silence urged Mark to add: ‘Bel’s had her share
of unhappiness, anyhow. She didn’t enjoy those three days much
more than I did and she’s lost more than a week down here. So
just be good to her, you deceptive little bit of adamant—and I’ll
bless you from my heart.’</p>

<p>‘That’s bribery!’ Sheila said laughing, and straightening her
shoulders. ‘I don’t take payment for my services. But it’s time
to go and dress for dinner!’</p>

<p>As they strolled back to the house she caught herself reflecting
quite philosophically on the impunity with which the Bels of this
world may steal horses, while their less privileged sisters dare not
cast a glance over the hedge.</p>

<p>But in spite of her excuse about dressing for dinner, she seemed
in no such hurry after all. A sudden longing came over her to
see the studio, to sit alone for a few minutes in that shrine of
blessed memories: and, having seen Mark safely vanish into his
bedroom, she made bold to venture in.</p>

<p>Sinking into Lady Forsyth’s armchair, she let the crowding
memories sweep through her brain, while her eyes ranged from
picture to picture, from statue to statue, as it were learning them
by heart, because in future the right of entry she so prized would
belong to another. For her, Mark and his art were one and indivisible;
and, by an unerring instinct, she dreaded the effect of
Bel’s demoralising influence on both.</p>

<p>Dearly she loved the virile figure of Triumph; more dearly still,
the Viking. Him, she saw and felt as Mark had hoped that Bel
might see and feel him. She had been at Wynchcombe Friars
during those wonderful days when he came to life under Mark’s
hands; and in her private heart she saw him as the symbol of his
creator’s unquenchable spirit.</p>

<p>In all these children of his hand and brain, she found the quintessence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_489"></a>[489]</span>
of the man, and it was her instinct to seek the essence of
things.</p>

<p>Mark himself, without and within, was all that she would have
a man be—she, who seemed fated to attract only the ‘poor things’
of earth. Since Ailsa’s death and his return from Europe, she had
worshipped him, with the still intensity of her northern nature.
So felicitous had been their relation, and she so young, so happy in a
home atmosphere the very antithesis of her own, that no afterthought
had troubled her unclouded content.</p>

<p>For this reason, she had been able to accept, loyally, uncritically,
his sudden and bewildering infatuation for a girl obviously unworthy
of him; an infatuation that could survive even his knowledge
of the motive which had prompted Bel to such unsparing use of
her power. Entirely one with him in spirit, she could not choose
but will what he willed: and conviction that Bel honestly loved him
had mitigated the pain of her own hidden disappointment in him.</p>

<p>But now even that faint consolation was gone: and here, where
associations were more intimate than at Inveraig, the shock to her
belief in him seemed infinitely harder to bear. Here the question
forced itself upon her—how <i>could</i> he, being what he was?</p>

<p>And his fresh appeal on behalf of Bel had badly shaken her
innate capacity for acceptance.</p>

<p>Because of that appeal—which would also be made to the others—this
girl, who had so cruelly tormented him for her own ends, must
not be allowed to suffer a twinge of the discomfort she so richly
deserved. For the first time, Sheila was goaded almost to the
point of rebellion. For the first time her will was at odds with his:
and it hurt more than she chose to admit. From a child she had
invented her own private code of courage that never allowed her
to say ‘I can’t bear it.’ And she would not say it now.</p>

<p>She would do what he asked, under protest, because he asked
it. Her attitude, she was convinced, would matter nothing to
Bel, who obviously looked down on her, from the attitude of her
twenty-nine years, with a mild good-humoured contempt. But it
would matter greatly to Mark;—and that sufficed.</p>

<p>She rose at last and wandered round the beloved room. Before
the Viking she stood a long while, trying to draw the valiant soul
of him into her own soul: then she went reluctantly out.</p>

<p>As she closed the door behind her, Mark opened his own and
smilingly confronted her. ‘Hullo! Is that the way you dress
for dinner?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_490"></a>[490]</span></p>

<p>She coloured a little under his gaze.</p>

<p>‘I couldn’t resist going in—just to greet them all.’</p>

<p>‘Well—you might have let me come too! Are they such very
special friends?’</p>

<p>‘A part of me—almost,’ she said very low. ‘I’ve known most
of them—haven’t I?—ever since they were born.’</p>

<p>Then she went quickly down the passage; and for several
seconds Mark stood looking after her. The sudden softening of his
whole face, could she have seen it, would have been balm to her
heart.</p>

<p>Next morning early, Mark drove Maurice to the main line station,
despatched him with a final volley of chaff, and proceeded patiently
to tramp the lane outside till the down train should bring him
the desire of his eyes. From the station-master he learnt that ‘she’
might be anything from twenty minutes to two hours late. Yesterday
five specials had run through, packed with horses and men,
and there would be more to-night.</p>

<p>‘Jolly for they Germans, sir!’ he added with a jovial wink.
‘They <i>do</i> say now that the British Army will be keeping Christmas
in Berlin!’</p>

<p>‘And on the other side they say the Kaiser will keep it in
London,’ Mark answered him. ‘Best leave fairy tales to the
Germans. It’s their line!’</p>

<p>And he retired to commune with his own heart in the lane.</p>

<p>The train gave him ample time to lose patience and recapture
it; and the longer he waited, the brighter grew the halo round
Bel’s golden head. Idealist as he was, in art and life, he could not
choose but idealise the woman he loved: if, indeed, he were not
rather in love with a phantom of his own brain, who wore the
appearance and spoke with the voice of Bel. During the last ten
days, while his conscious mind had been absorbed in things practical,
the subconscious, unoccupied artist in him had been sedulously
gilding her halo; and as for that bewildering jar in Scotland, he
had so completely credited her with his own sensitiveness on the
subject, that his one wish was to make her forget it had ever been.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_491"></a>[491]</span>
He had shrank even from asking her to speak of it to his mother;
and had made the request in his last letter, rather than spring an
unpleasantness on her by way of greeting.</p>

<p>And now—all he craved was herself. Her letters were not the
same thing at all. Clever, affectionate and often amusing, they
seemed just to miss something that, for him, was the secret of
her charm. In them the slightly studied effect of her whole attitude
to life seemed more definitely artificial; and after reading them,
a troubled uncertainty was apt to pervade his mind. But sight
and touch of her would cure all such lover’s folly⸺</p>

<p>Ah—the whistle at last!</p>

<p>He reached the platform as the train drew up, and there emerged
from a distant carriage the tall, unmistakable figure in a bluish
coat and skirt and close-fitting hat. About midway down the
platform they met and clasped hands. She coloured a little when
their eyes met; but they merely talked of luggage and the lateness
of the train.</p>

<p>It is a common experience, that first, faint shock of actual
meeting after keen anticipation; and in these two it waked the
undersense that, although they had taken the most hazardous
step in life, they were still comparative strangers. In some vague
way they seemed to have lost touch; to have become suddenly
shy of each other—the man more so than the girl.</p>

<p>Shy or no, she was contented, utterly, to be sitting there beside
him in the August sunlight, speeding between stretches of ripe
cornland; between purple sweeps of heather, when they climbed
a ridge; and on through rolling open country where the earlier
trees showed a yellow leaf or two, and the oaks were still sunset-tinted
with their second blossoming. England, relying serenely
upon her grey ghosts of the North Sea, lay dozing in the high noon
of the year, while little Belgium, like another Kate Barlass, thrust
her arm through the bolt that the murderers might be stayed were
it only for a moment. A Territorial Camp, an occasional motor
decked with flags, a group of khaki figures resting in the shade—these
were the sole reminders of that invisible horror across the
Channel, that for Bel was no more than the shadow of a shadow;
though the cloud of it overhung her own life and sat visibly upon
her lover’s brow.</p>

<p>Every now and then she took stock of him under her eyelids,
from his rough motor-cap and his sensitive mouth, safe-guarded
by that uncompromising chin, to the lean, strong fingers controlling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_492"></a>[492]</span>
the machine. A woman could safely entrust her destiny to that
mouth and those hands, though she might wish, incidentally, that
he would take a less exaggerated view of this singularly inopportune
war. It was just her luck that it should have been timed to
spoil the most promising ‘phase’ of her life. If only Mark’s
admirable virility were tempered by a touch of Rex Maitland’s
intelligent common sense, matters would be so much easier and
pleasanter all round. And the coming interview with Lady Forsyth
was a nuisance, to put it mildly: but still⸺</p>

<p>‘Have I given you time to get through the worst of your troublesome
affairs?’ she asked after an interchange of commonplaces
that led nowhere. ‘I’m hoping for a clear field as the reward of
my lost week.’</p>

<p>He gave her a contrite glance.</p>

<p>‘I wish it were clearer. Russell, my land-agent, has played up
like a Trojan. But the wood seems to thicken as one goes on.
And to-day I’m booked for a recruiting show at Bramleigh. No
getting out of it. Sir Nevil Sinclair—the artist, you know—said
I <i>must</i> manage to placate you somehow. So please <i>be</i> placated
and save me the managing!’</p>

<p>Down went the corners of her mouth. ‘Our first day! And
not even Mr. Lenox to play with.’</p>

<p>‘Won’t Sheila do?’</p>

<p>‘As a substitute for <i>you</i>? Mark, your modesty is incredible!
Is she with you still?’</p>

<p>‘She came back yesterday.’</p>

<p>‘And Mr. Macnair?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’</p>

<p>‘Are they part of your permanent family, those two?’</p>

<p>‘More or less. People just accrue to Mums. Are you placated
now—Queen of Wynchcombe Friars?’</p>

<p>She laid gloved finger-tips on his knee.</p>

<p>‘I’m trying to be. I vowed a vow to be heavenly good this
time, to make up for....’</p>

<p>His hand closed on hers.</p>

<p>‘That’s over and done with,’ he said. ‘I’m sorry—even about
Mother. But it seemed only fair. I’ll take you to her straight—’</p>

<p>‘I’d prefer half an hour first with her son—<i>not</i> in a motor
on the open road! Darling, give me time to feel more at
home.’</p>

<p>His eyes sought hers. ‘I’m agreeable. We’ll stop at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_493"></a>[493]</span>
gate and go up through the wood. I can fetch the car afterwards.
No superfluous attendants these days!’</p>

<p>On a cushion of moss in the cool of the pine-wood, they recaptured
the atmosphere of Scotland and the little cloud of estrangement
melted away. Mark, who had keenly felt the momentary
jar, was the more relieved.</p>

<p>‘Now, my darling girl, time’s up,’ he said; reluctant, but
inflexible, ‘Mother will be picturing us wrecked on the road, and
sending poor old Keith to pick up the pieces! Come.’</p>

<p>At that, she knelt upright, and, with a charmingly tender air of
proprietorship, passed her hands over his head, bringing them to
rest on his shoulders. ‘I’m glad I’ve found you again,’ she said.
‘That strange man at the station rather alarmed me.’</p>

<p>‘<i>You</i> knew how to conjure him away, you witch!’ he answered,
stopping her lips with a kiss.</p>

<p>She accepted the kiss, but not his tacit dismissal of the subject.
For her, a new sensation not analysed was a sensation
wasted.</p>

<p>‘I suppose it was that things hadn’t time to crystallise properly
after the break,’ she went on, twisting a button between her finger
and thumb. ‘I hope the War Office will be merciful and allow us
a good spell this time. Separations are rather uncanny things.
You never quite know⸺’</p>

<p>‘Well, if you don’t know me when I get back this evening,’ he
said, with perfect gravity, ‘the marriage that has been arranged,
etc., had better not take place.’</p>

<p>‘Mark!’ Her voice had a sharp, startled note.</p>

<p>‘That’ll learn you!’ he retorted, smiling. ‘We’ll make out our
“para” to-morrow.’</p>

<p>And he heard no more of the subject.</p>

<p>They found Lady Forsyth alone in the drawing-room reading
her midday post.</p>

<p>‘My dears!’ She sprang up to greet them. ‘We’ve been
wondering what had come to you.’</p>

<p>Mark explained, asked a few questions, backed casually towards
the door—and vanished, leaving the women alone.</p>

<p>Bel had resolved that there should be neither awkwardness nor
hesitation. Already she had rehearsed the little scene half a dozen
times; and as the door closed, she turned to the small, upright
figure near the piano, both hands flung out.</p>

<p>‘Dear Lady Forsyth, you <i>are</i> going to forgive me, aren’t you?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_494"></a>[494]</span>
I know I don’t deserve it. But Mark has been so beautifully
generous⸺’</p>

<p>‘That is easier for him than for his mother,’ Lady Forsyth
rejoined with her disconcerting frankness: but her smile made
partial atonement and she took the proffered hands. ‘Not that
I’m belittling Mark’s generosity. It takes a just man to be generous
even in exasperating circumstances; and Mark possesses that rare
quality in a high degree. He particularly wants us all to make
light of the whole matter; and—to please him, Bel, I can at least
condone what I can’t pretend to understand.’</p>

<p>This—as may be supposed—was not precisely the cue Bel had
prepared for herself. But she had the adaptability of the born
actress; and she recognised that Lady Forsyth had paid her the
embarrassing compliment of speaking her mind as to a daughter.</p>

<p>‘That’s rather a crushing form of forgiveness!’ she said, with
the pretty droop of her lips. ‘And I don’t suppose it’s much use
trying to explain....’</p>

<p>‘Not the slightest, my dear.’ Lady Forsyth’s tone was brisk
but kindly. ‘Facts, like beauty, are best left unadorned. I take
it for granted you must have been very much upset to hurt a brave
man so unnecessarily. Had your refusal been final, I could have
better understood.’</p>

<p>The girl flinched at that and bit her lip. ‘You don’t sound
much like forgiving me. And I don’t think,’ she made bold to add,
‘that Mark would be quite pleased if he heard you.’</p>

<p>‘He would probably bite my head off,’ Lady Forsyth answered,
taking the wind out of her sails. ‘And if you want to make him
angry with me, you can tell him what I have said. I should say
just the same if he were present. Mark and I are in complete
accord, however much we squabble. He knows my bark is worse
than my bite: and you’ll soon know it too, Bel. So don’t let’s
write in brass what is meant to be writ in water. We shall gain
nothing by making Mark our apple of discord. He’s a very large
apple, big enough for two! Now, after that, let me “behave”
and show you to your room. Later on, you must see over the dear
old house.’</p>

<p>‘Yes. It’s a dream of a place.’ Bel swerved thankfully to
a more congenial subject and the still more congenial reflection
that all this stately, soft-toned beauty would some day be her
own.</p>

<p>Once this wretched war was over, everything would go<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_495"></a>[495]</span>
swimmingly. He would settle down and shed some of his troublesome
ideals. That flat in town—which she had already chosen and
furnished mentally—would be the best possible antidote for what
she vaguely styled ‘that sort of thing.’ She washed her hands and
tidied her smooth hair in a frame of mind too serene even to be
clouded by the prospect of a whole afternoon without Mark.</p>

<p>And downstairs, alone in the drawing-room, Lady Forsyth was
playing Grieg’s Temple dance with a fire and fury that brought
Keith in from the terrace, startled concern in his eyes.</p>

<p>‘Bless my soul, Helen! Who are you wanting to murder
now? The Crown Prince or one of our own super-Solomons?’</p>

<p>‘Neither,’ she answered, crashing out the last double chord.
Then, swinging round on the stool she faced him with heightened
colour, head in air. ‘It’s Mark’s future wife. And I’m in terror
that he’ll want to marry before he goes out. Keith—it’s not only
wicked prejudice. I distrust her more than ever. She came to
me with a pretty, ready-made apology which I am afraid I dislocated
by my incurable candour. Then, having let fly for my
own satisfaction, I proceeded to smooth things over for love of
Mark. Told her my bark was worse than my bite.’</p>

<p>‘That I can swear to,’ Keith struck in smiling.</p>

<p>‘Still—by every oath I mustn’t use, if I was a natural savage
instead of a Christian woman, who adores her son, I’d <i>bite</i> her with
all my teeth.—There! Between that and Grieg, I feel a little
better. But oh, you sagacious bachelor, you have your divine
compensations. At times it’s a positive curse to love any human
thing better than your own soul.’</p>

<p>‘It is that,’ Macnair agreed with quiet emphasis, as the door
opened to admit Mark himself.</p>

<p>The air seemed still to vibrate with Helen’s impassioned outburst,
and he glanced quickly from one to the other.</p>

<p>‘What have you two been plotting—eh?’</p>

<p>‘The wholesale reconstruction of the universe!’ Keith answered
lightly; but Mark went straight to his mother and laid his hand
on her.</p>

<p>‘She’s been working herself up about nothing,’ he said. ‘I
can feel her quivering all through. Keith, you oughtn’t to encourage
her. She’ll be needing all her reserves of strength, if she’s
to pull through this. Would the drive to Bramleigh calm you
down, Motherling? Or would it churn you up again, hearing me
speak?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_496"></a>[496]</span></p>

<p>‘No: I should love it,’ she answered in a low voice. The
invitation and the touch of his hand had soothed her already, as
nothing else could have done. It was as if, by some telepathic
process, he had divined the cause of her emotional stress; and
when the two girls came in he said casually, without removing his
hand: ‘I’m carrying Mums off with me to Bramleigh. You’ve
had your drive, Bel, and the outing will do her a power of good.’</p>

<p>The announcement faintly ruffled Bel’s conviction that all was
for the best in this best of all possible worlds. But later in the
evening, when her own turn came, when she wandered with Mark
through the terraced gardens down to the river, he found her
apparently satisfied, if not communicative, as regards her interview
of the morning. Convinced of her own supreme sovereignty,
instinct told her that she would gain nothing by ‘giving the woman
away.’</p>
